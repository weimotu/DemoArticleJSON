Attempts to identify seizure and psychoso-cial risk factors for underachievement have yielded inconsistentfindings, raising the possibility that seizure and psychosocialvariables play a complex role in combination with other vari-ables such as neuropsychological functioning. This study cross-validated a neuropsychological measurement model for child-hood epilepsy, examined the relation between neuropsychologi-cal functioning and academic achievement, and tested the degreeto which demographic, seizure, and psychosocial variables mod-erate that relation.\\nMethods: Children with chronic epilepsy (N =173; ages\\n8 to 15 years; 49% girls; 91% white/non-Hispanic; 79% oneseizure type; 79% taking one medication; 69% with activeseizures) completed a comprehensive neuropsychological bat-tery. Children diagnosed with mental retardation were excluded.\\nResults: Structural equation modeling identified a three-\\nfactor measurement model of neuropsychological function:Verbal/Memory/Executive (VME), Rapid Naming/Working\\nMemory (RN/WM), and Psychomotor (PM). VME and RN/WMwere strongly related to reading, math, and writing; PM predictedwriting only. Family environment moderated the impact of neu-ropsychological deficits on writing (p ≤0.01) and possibly for\\nreading (p =0.05); neuropsychological deficits had a smaller\\nimpact on achievement for children in supportive/organizedhomes compared with children in unsupportive/disorganizedhomes.\\nConclusions: These findings lend partial support for our theo-\\nretical model showing direct effects of neuropsychological func-tion on achievement and the moderating role of family factors.This study suggests that a subgroup of children with epilepsy(those who have not only neuropsychological deficits but alsodisorganized/unsupportive home environments) are particularlyat risk for adverse academic outcomes. Implications for inter-vention are discussed. Key Words: Epilepsy—Children—\\nFamily—Cognition—Academic achievement.\\nChildren with epilepsy are at great risk for academic dif-\\nficulties (1–7) and for underemployment as adults (6,8).Fastenau et al. (9) described a model to explain how var-ious risk factors might contribute to academic problems.In that model, neuropsychological functioning appears toplay an integral role, possibly mediating the effects ofstructural and electrophysiologic abnormalities (10–14).Other risk factors in the model include seizure, demo-graphic, and psychosocial variables (9).\\nStudies to date have not been consistent in identifying\\nseizure variables (e.g., seizure type, age at onset, seizure\\nAccepted June 20, 2004.\\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. P.S. Fastenau\\nat Psychology (LD 124), Indiana University Purdue University Indi-anapolis, 402 N. Blackford Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202-3275, U.S.A.E-mail: pfastena@iupui.eduseverity) that might influence the relation between neu-\\nropsychological functioning and academic achievementin children with epilepsy. For example, some studies haveshown academic underachievement to be associated withabsence epilepsy more so than with juvenile rheuma-toid arthritis (15), and children with generalized seizuresdemonstrated worse outcomes than did those with partialseizures (5,16,17). Still, others found no association be-tween seizure type and academic achievement (4,18,19),and no studies of academic achievement examined theinteraction between seizure type and neuropsychologicalfunctioning.\\nAn early age at onset for seizures was associated with\\nworse cognitive function in many studies (e.g., 5,20–22); yet others failed to find a relation (18,23). Persis-tent seizures and greater seizure severity also have been\\n12611262 P . S. FASTENAU ET AL.\\nassociated with greater academic underachievement in\\nchildren (1,15), but others have failed to find a relationbetween seizure severity and achievement (e.g., 4). Thelack of consistency in this literature suggests a need forfurther evaluation of seizure variables in academic func-tioning, particularly as they might interact with other vari-ables (i.e., moderate other relations).\\nIn addition to seizure variables, demographic and psy-\\nchosocial variables might serve as moderators in therelation between neuropsychological functioning and aca-demic achievement. Past studies suggest that gender, fam-ily environment, and children ’s perceptions influence aca-\\ndemic achievement in children with epilepsy. With re-gard to gender, a study of children with epilepsy foundmales to be more at risk for academic underachievementthan females (1). In contrast, Howe et al. (24) foundmale adolescents, including those with neurologic con-ditions, had higher achievement scores than did adoles-cent females. In addition, low stimulation and supportin the family environment were related to poorer aca-demic achievement in children with seizures (4). Neg-ative child attitudes and perceptions have been associ-ated with poorer academic performance in children withepilepsy (1). Negative attributions have been observed inepilepsy for both adults (25) and teens (26), and such attri-butions have been associated with poor academic achieve-ment in school-age children (27). Despite the support forthe roles of these psychosocial factors on classroom suc-cess, no studies have examined the extent to which psy-chosocial variables might interact with neuropsychologi-\\ncal functioning to influence academic achievement in thispopulation.\\nPast studies focusing on seizure and psychosocial pre-\\ndictors of achievement in childhood epilepsy have beenlimited in several ways. They tended to rely on grouptests of achievement or parent report or both, rather thanusing well-validated individual achievement tests (e.g., 1).In addition, neuropsychological functioning in many ofthose studies was assessed with limited measures, or alarge battery of tests was used with no attempt to reducethe data into fewer and more relevant constructs (e.g., 28).We identified only one study of neuropsychology and aca-demic achievement with this population that included afactor analysis to reduce the test battery into fewer, moresalient neuropsychological constructs (29). Most impor-tant, no study to date has modeled the complex moderatingroles of demographic, seizure, and psychosocial variableson the relation between neuropsychological functioningand academic achievement.\\nThe present study builds on past studies by (1) recruit-\\ning a large sample of school-age children with diverseseizure types, (2) using a more comprehensive battery ofneuropsychological and achievement tests, (3) exploringthe factor structure of that battery, (4) modeling the relativecontributions of each of these cognitive deficits to specificoutcomes in each major academic domain, and (5) testing\\nwhether demographic, seizure, and psychosocial variablesserve as moderators of the relation between neuropsycho-logical functioning and academic achievement.\\nMETHODS\\nSample\\nParticipants were recruited from outpatient pediatric\\nneurology clinics, private pediatric neurology practices,and school nurses in Indiana and neighboring areas. Let-ters, brochures, and flyers were sent to nurses at all schoolson a mailing list that was provided by the State of Indi-ana. In addition, all child neurology clinics in the GreaterIndianapolis area were contacted and were provided let-ters, brochures, and flyers describing the study. The sam-ple size was determined based on power analyses con-ducted before initiation of the study. Of the 173 childrenwho participated, 165 completed neuropsychological andachievement testing. Seven of the eight who did not com-plete neuropsychological testing did complete extensiveinterviews for the study by phone (or mail, in one case),which suggests that travel limited their involvement in theneuropsychological testing (which required coming to themedical center); the eighth family withdrew from the studyshortly after enrollment and did not give a reason. Partic-ipants who did not complete neuropsychological testingwere not used in any analyses in the article. Age rangedfrom 8 to 15 years. Each child entered the study with a di-agnosis of epilepsy; all children were taking antiepilepticmedications at the time of enrollment. Children were ex-cluded if they had another chronic physical condition, orhad been diagnosed with mental retardation, or had beenclassified by the schools as mentally handicapped (basedon parent report of the school ’s evaluation) before enroll-\\nment into the study. Demographic and clinical character-istics of the sample are presented Table 1. EEGs showedno spike –wave activity for 40% of our participants, con-\\nsistent with literature documenting a false-negative rate ashigh as 70% after a single routine EEG (30).\\nProcedure\\nAn institutional review board approved the study;\\nlegal guardians of all participants signed informed con-sent statements before participation, and the children gaveinformed assent. Parents completed an extensive struc-tured interview by phone with a carefully trained nurse orclinical research assistant; demographic data and seizurehistory were obtained as part of that interview. The chil-dren completed a structured interview by phone and com-pleted a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation atthe medical center. In addition, a board-certified childneurologist (D.W.D.) reviewed EEGs, neuroimaging re-ports [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computedtomography (CT) or both], and clinic notes to classify\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2004MODERATORS OF ACHIEVEMENT IN EPILEPSY 1263\\nTABLE 1.

Table 3 identifies the specific variables analyzed,organized by the neuropsychological domain. All instru-ments were administered according to the standardizedprocedures for each test; scores were converted to age-corrected standardized scores by using the best availablenational norms for all tests except Wide Range Assess-ment of Memory and Learning (WRAML) Design Copy,for which no norms were available.Moderating variables\\nThree groups of moderating variables were tested\\nin this study: demographic, seizure, and psychosocial(child/family) variables.

The Child Attitude Toward IllnessScale (CATIS, 31) measured the child ’s attitude toward\\nhaving epilepsy. This 13-item scale has shown good relia-bility and validity (31,32), and Cronbach ’s alpha was good\\n(α=0.78) in the present study; possible mean scores range\\nfrom 1 to 5. For self-concept, the Happiness-Satisfactionsubscale of the Piers-Harris Children ’s Self-Concept Scale\\n(33) was used. This 10-item subscale (possible scoresrange from 0 to 10) has shown good reliability and validity,including in children with epilepsy (33,34), and reliabilitywas adequate in the present study ( α=0.63).\\nFor attributional style, the Negative Composite scale of\\nthe Children ’s Attributional Style Questionnaire (CASQ,\\n35) was used. The Negative Composite scale consists of 24items (possible scores range from 0 to 24); higher scoresindicate a stronger tendency to explain bad events in termsof internal, stable, and global causes. The CASQ has beenfound to have satisfactory validity with children who hada chronic condition and were similar in age (36), but thereliability of the Negative Composite score was weak inthe present study ( α=0.44).\\nFamily environment was measured by the primary care-\\ngivers ’ratings on the Family Inventory of Resources for\\nManagement (FIRM, 37). The present study used an ab-breviated Family Mastery subscale consisting of the 18items with the highest factor loadings in earlier studies.Possible mean scores range from 0 to 3; a higher scorereflects a more supportive, organized family environmentwith few disruptions in daily routines and interactions.The 18 items measure family planning and problem solv-ing, decision making, cooperation among family mem-bers, distribution of responsibilities for household tasks,organization, ability to complete important tasks, emo-tional support, and stress in the family. The subscale hasshown good reliability and validity (37); reliability was\\nvery good in the present study ( α=0.88).\\nStatistical analysis\\nData analyses followed a two-step procedure. In step 1,\\nexploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to iden-tify a factor structure model (measurement model, Fig. 1)for the neuropsychological variables. This was followedby confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 8(38) to examine further the fit of the model and to identifypotential modifications to the model.\\nIn step 2, structural equation modeling (SEM) with\\nLISREL 8 was used to test the direct links between neu-ropsychological function and academic achievement in thestructural model (Fig. 2). Statistically, it would be idealto test the moderator effects by incorporating moderatorsinto the SEM models; unfortunately, our sample size wastoo small to fit the SEM models with stable estimates.Therefore conventional regression models were used totest the interactions between the neuropsychological fac-tors and moderators. We first created a composite score foreach neuropsychological factor based on the item factorloadings resulting from the CFA model. Because of thesample-size concerns, we tested the significance of eachmoderator variable in separate models instead of puttingall moderators into a single model (after controlling formain effects of the three neuropsychological factors). SASVersion 8.2 software (39) was used for the conventional re-gression analyses. All models were fit by using the methodof maximum likelihood.\\nFor examining direct effects, αwas set to p ≤0.05, with\\np≤0.10 considered a trend. Because of the large number\\nof significance tests required to test the models examiningmoderation, αwas set more conservatively (p ≤0.01),\\nand findings at p ≤0.05 were considered trends and were\\ninterpreted with caution in those models.\\nRESULTS\\nThe standardized scores for the sample are presented in\\nTable 3. Normative values for each test also are providedfor reference.\\nStep 1: Measurement model\\nExploratory factor analysis\\nThe initial factor structures among 16 neuropsycholog-\\nical variables were explored by using EFA. The EFA re-sults showed that three latent factors might be underlyingthe neuropsychological variables. About 56% of the totalvariance was explained by the three factors. The numberof factors was determined based on the scree plot andinterpretability. All three factors had eigenvalues >1.0,\\nat least four variables per factor, and reasonable clini-cal interpretations.

Table4 shows that all loadings except the loading of WRAMLDesign Memory to VME are significant. The loading ofWRAML Design Memory to VME was retained becauseit fits equally well with the other memory and learningsubtests on VME. Squared multiple correlation (SMC) isa measure of strength of a linear relation between an ob-served variable and its underlying factor. In practice, itgives a measure of how much variance of the variable isexplained by the underlying factor. In Table 4, it can beseen that the values of SMC range from 0.22 to 0.73, in-dicating the model has an acceptable fit, given that 56%of the total variance is explained by the three factors.In summary, we identified three factors underlying neu-\\nropsychological performance in this sample (Fig. 1).

We fit separate\\nSEM models for each domain of academic achievement;that is, we fit one model for reading, another model formath, and a third model for writing. It was further hy-pothesized that demographic, seizure, and psychosocialvariables would moderate the prediction process in thestructural model (Fig. 2).\\nTo determine whether our theoretical models were sup-\\nported, we examined goodness-of-fit indices for the SEMmodels (Table 5). The table shows that all models havea GFI of 0.87, CFI >0.95, and RMSEA and RMR val-\\nues∼0.06. Although goodness-of-fit of the models is re-\\njected based on the χ\\n2criterion, it is known that the χ2\\ntest statistic is very sensitive to sample size and depar-\\ntures from multivariate normality. In practice, it is recom-mended that the model χ\\n2test be used only for model\\ncomparisons, with smaller values having better fit.

From the standardized coefficients, we\\ncan see the importance of each neuropsychological factorrelated to academic achievement. VME is the most impor-tant neuropsychological factor because it has the higheststandardized coefficients for the three models (0.69, 0.57,and 0.86 for reading, math, and writing models, respec-tively). RN/WM is the next most important factor becauseits standard coefficients are lower than those for VME buthigher than those for PM. PM has the smallest standard-ized coefficients in each model; this pattern is consistentwith what was shown by formal significance tests.\\nModerating effects\\nOnly Family Mastery (FM) was found to have signif-\\nicant moderating effects. The results are graphically pre-sented in Figures 3 to 5. For writing achievement, eachmodel (VME, RN/WM, and FM main effects and their in-teractions with FM) explained 56% of the total variance.The FM main effect and FM ×VME interaction (p =\\n0.004) accounted for 3.7% of the total variance (or 6.6%of the explained variance); the FM main effect and FM×RN/WM interaction (p =0.01) accounted for 2.9% of\\nthe total variance (or 5.2% of the explained variance). Itcan be seen from Figures 3 and 4 that the relation betweenneuropsychological functioning and writing achievementvaried depending on FM level; VME and RN/WM werestrongly related to writing achievement in those childrenwith less FM (i.e., with disorganization and little supportat home), but neuropsychological deficits had little or nodetrimental impact on writing achievement for childrenwith greater FM (i.e., with organization and strong sup-port at home). The pattern was nearly identical for bothinteractions.\\nFor reading achievement, a trend was noted for an in-\\nteraction between FM and VME (p =0.05). The model\\n(VME, RN/WM, and FM main effects and the FM ×VME\\ninteraction) explained 54% of the total variance in reading.The FM main effect and FM ×VME interaction accounted\\nfor 2.2% of the total variance (or 4.1% of the explainedvariance). As can be seen in Figure 5, the pattern of thisinteraction was nearly identical to the previous two inter-actions between neuropsychological functioning and FM.Because this trend follows the same pattern of two more-robust findings and because it is theoretically defensible,this trend was considered to be interpretable, albeit subjectto replication.\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 45, No. 10, 20041268 P .

More important,previous studies examined only direct effects without at-tempting to model complex moderating relations. Thepresent study built on past studies by recruiting a largesample of school-age children with diverse seizure types;by using a more comprehensive battery of neuropsycho-logical and achievement tests; and by testing a complexmodel that incorporates demographic, seizure, and psy-chosocial variables as moderators of the relation betweenneuropsychological functioning and academic achieve-ment. We first discuss the reduction of neuropsycho-logical data into composites or factors (measurementmodel). Then we discuss the moderating relations (struc-tural model) and their implications for intervention.\\nMeasurement model\\nOur three-factor model compares very favorably with\\na study by Seidenberg et al. (29). In a very similarsample (147 children with epilepsy, ages 9 –14 years)\\nthey extracted six factors (in order of strength): VerbalSkills/Verbal Learning; Spatial Skills/Executive; Atten-tion; Visual Memory/Learning; Fine Motor/Construction;and Visual-Motor Speed. Our primary factor (VME) con-sisted of the same skills represented in their first threefactors (verbal skills, verbal memory/learning, spatialskills/executive, attention). Our third factor (PM) was sim-ilar to their last three factors (fine motor skills, visual-motor speed, and visual-spatial memory); spatial skills,attention, visual-spatial memory, motor, and visual-motorconstructs separated into unique factors in the earlier studymost likely because many more measures were in eachdomain than were in the present study. Consequently, ourstudy appears to cross-validate this measurement modelwith regard to these neuropsychological constructs.\\nBy contrast, however, we identified an additional fac-\\ntor that was not observed by Seidenberg et al. (29). TheRN/WM factor observed here was unique because the ear-lier study did not include specific measures of rapid nam-ing or auditory-verbal working memory. These constructshave become increasingly salient with regard to academicachievement (particularly for reading) since the time ofthe study by Seidenberg et al. (e.g., 40 –42). Their emer-\\ngence as a coherent factor (independent of general verbalskills) supports their unique role in the developing cogni-tive repertoire of the school-aged child.\\nStructural model\\nDirect effects\\nVME and achievement. VME was strongly related\\nto all three academic outcomes. Inasmuch as this factorrepresents broader cognitive abilities (somewhat akin toglobal intelligence), this is not surprising. Verbal skills\\nhave been shown to be strongly predictive of generalacademic achievement in children with epilepsy (29,43)and to vocational outcomes in high school students withepilepsy (8). Seidenberg et al. (29) showed that in addi-tion to verbal abilities, attention strongly discriminatedbetween successful and unsuccessful achievers.\\nRN/WM and achievement. RN/WM was strongly re-\\nlated to all three academic outcomes. Rapid naming andworking memory play a prominent role in vocabulary de-velopment and reading (40 –42,44). It is reasonable to ex-\\npect that these skills would also play a role in writing(e.g., drawing on the same internal lexicon). A longitu-dinal study supported the relation between reading andwriting in the age range of the current sample (45), andsome direct empirical support exists for the shared role ofphonologic processes and working memory in particular(46,47). The role of RN/WM has been appreciated in mathas well (e.g., 48,49).\\nPM and writing. Psychomotor skills were strongly re-\\nlated to writing achievement. It is important to note in thisregard that our writing achievement measures were not\\nscored on the basis of handwriting or neatness. Instead,those measures reflect spelling, punctuation, grammar,and syntactical expression. The relation between visual-motor skills and writing development is well established,and a recent longitudinal study demonstrates their criticalrole in later writing mechanics and not just handwriting(45).\\nModerating effects\\nAcademic achievement was less affected by neuropsy-\\nchological deficits when children ’s homes were more or-\\nganized and supportive. However, in homes that were dis-organized, disruptive, and unsupportive, neuropsycholog-ical deficiencies were related to much lower achievement.\\nOne other study showed that the family environment\\nis important for children with epilepsy. Mitchell et al.(4) assessed socioeconomic factors, home environment,and seizure/treatment variables in a sample of 78 childrenwith epilepsy (ages 5 –13 years). After adjusting achieve-\\nment scores for IQ, family environment (e.g., emotionalclimate, stimulation, parental involvement) accounted fora significant amount of variance in reading compre-hension, general knowledge, and basic reading (word-identification/word-attack skills). Family environment didnot account for any unique variance in math computationsor spelling; math reasoning and writing composition werenot assessed in that study. Seizure variables were unre-lated to IQ-adjusted achievement in most domains, withthe exception of a very subtle effect of duration of disorderwith computational math.\\nSimilar findings have been demonstrated in pediatric\\ntraumatic brain injury (TBI). Taylor et al. (50) found re-covery of math skills only for children whose families\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 45, No. 10, 20041270 P . S. FASTENAU ET AL.\\nreported less stress, thus demonstrating the protective role\\nof a supportive, stable family environment in academicachievement in a neurologic population. Family factorswere not associated with changes in neuropsychologicalfunctioning in that sample (51); this suggests that theimpact of neuropsychological deficiencies on academicachievement is moderated by the family environment in\\nTBI, which parallels the findings in the present study inchildren with epilepsy.\\nSeveral possible explanations exist for how the family\\nenvironment exerts its influence. Organization, support,planning, and order at home can help the child with cog-nitive limitations to complete homework. In addition, in-volving the parents in the learning process has dramaticeffects on achievement, even compared with additionalformal reading training (52 –54). In addition to educa-\\ntional interventions with the family, psychotherapy withthe family can be very beneficial for children with specialneeds (53) and for individuals with epilepsy, in partic-ular (55). These influences could be expected to bene-fit any child with special needs, including children withepilepsy.\\nA disorder-specific benefit for children with epilepsy\\nmight exist, inasmuch as a more organized family couldpossibly promote better sleep habits and medication ad-herence, both of which can contribute to better seizurecontrol (e.g., 56 –58). Studies by Dahl et al. (59,60) docu-\\nment the lasting impact of psychosocial interventions onseizure control, which might be one mechanism by whichfamily environment improves academic achievement inchildren with cognitive deficits.\\nNone of the other moderating variables was significant.\\nLearned helplessness might not have entered the modelbecause of low reliability. Self-concept was measured byusing the Happiness-Satisfaction Subscale rather than theacademic self-concept, because the latter would be ex-pected to be affected by achievement. This might havebeen too global a construct. Even though other moderatorvariables showed direct relations with academic achieve-ment in past research, as described in the introduction tothis article, they do not appear to moderate the impact ofneuropsychological deficits on achievement.\\nLimitations\\nSome possible limitations exist for this study. First, the\\nmodest reliability of the CASQ might have limited its sen-sitivity. Second, the hypothesized direct and moderatingrelations were construed theoretically to be causal and oc-curring over time in the structural model; however, thedesign of the study was correlational and cross-sectionalin nature, precluding conclusions of causation. In addition,conventional regression modeling does not take into ac-count measurement error but rather assumes the compos-ite variables to be accurate measures for the latent ability;thus the moderating relations are preliminary and mustbe further confirmed by SEM. Finally, the findings re-\\ngarding the family environment might not be unique tochildren with epilepsy; a control group in future studiescould help to delineate the extent to which those findingsand other aspects of the model differ for children withepilepsy compared with healthy children or children withnonneurologic chronic health conditions.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe present study suggests that a subgroup of children\\nwith epilepsy (those with neuropsychological deficits and\\ndisorganized unsupportive home environments) are par-ticularly at risk for adverse academic outcomes. Theseoutcomes might be ameliorated with aggressive familyintervention to increase structure, stability, and emotionalsupport in the home. Further research would help to de-velop and test such interventions.\\nAcknowledgment: This research was supported by grant\\nPHS R01 NR04536 from the National Institute of Nursing Re-search to J.K.A.

Introduction\\nPeople with epilepsy have for centuries been believed\\nto be notorious underachievers at school or incapable ofattending school due to a cognitive deﬁcit. The belief hasinvariably been based on studies about epilepsy in spe-cial schoolchildren and institutionalized patients and,thus, biased by selection [1]. Indeed, a WHO report\\nfound the main problem to be the lack of truly unbiasedsamples for testing [2]. Early data from institutions\\nshowed 35–60% of the mentally retarded to have epi-\\nlepsy [3,4]. More recent, population-based studies [5–7]\\nfound epilepsy in 23–33% of mentally retarded people.On the other hand, among those with epilepsy, 31–41% are reportedly retarded [8–12] .There are still only few epidemiological research-\\nbased data on cognitive deﬁcits causing learning distur-\\nbances in people who have epilepsy. One fundamental\\nproblem is the inconsistent use of the terms mentalretardation (MR) and learning disability (LD). Noconsensus so far exists, because, in a very recent discus-sion, some would like to keep the terms separated [13],\\nsome others want to have the term LD as an umbrellaterm for all conditions with learning disability [14],a n d\\nthe remaining authors simply do not discuss the prob-\\nlem. Most of the prevalence studies are cross-sectional\\nand give only rates of prevalence of MR [8,10–12,15–\\n19], omitting those who have LD but normal intelli-\\ngence (IQ > 70) [20]. In the National Child Develop-\\nment Study of 15,496 children, 64 children haddeveloped epilepsy by the age of 11. At that age, 43were in normal schools, 20 were in special schools,and 1 child was at home [10]. In a Scandinavian study\\nof 36,500 children, 155 had epilepsy.

In another Scandinavian popula-\\ntion-based study, MR occurred in 39% of 198 childrenwith epilepsy who were derived from an unselectedpopulation of 38,500 children [17]. Still another Scandi-\\nnavian population study of 49,000 children [12] re-\\nported MR in 38% (mild in 14% and severe in 24%).\\nCerebral palsy was much more common among chil-dren with severe MR (49%) than among those withmild MR (14%). From the same patient series, Beck-ung et al. [21]later recruited those who had no other\\nneurological deﬁcits, such as MR, cerebral palsy, andsimilar deﬁcits, for the assessment of their sensoryand motor function. Thirty percent of their study sub-\\njects with epilepsy but without additional neurological\\nimpairments exhibited gross motor functional deﬁcitsin balance, coordination, and speed. The study didnot consider the intelligence level among these nonre-tarded subjects.\\nBrorson and Wranne [22]followed 194 of 195 chil-\\ndren for 12 years with respect to survival and seizureprognosis. An initial ‘‘neurodeﬁcit’’ or abnormal neuro-\\nlogical examination, MR, or frequent seizures or any\\ncombination proved to be a negative prognostic factor.Forty-one percent of patients with a neurological deﬁcitand 79% of those without any neurodeﬁcit were in 3-year terminal remission at the end of follow-up.\\nCamﬁeld et al. [23]classiﬁed their patients with re-\\nspect to intelligence level into four groups: normal, mildto severe mental retardation, learning disorder, and\\nlearning disorder with behavioral disorder. The latter\\ntwo groups were not deﬁned. Twelve percent were clin-ically assessed as mentally retarded and 16% had alearning disorder. No data were given on the remaining4%. A Japanese clinic-based follow-up study [18]found\\na signiﬁcantly higher remission rate in the mentally nor-mal than in the mentally retarded (IQ < 70) (76% vs37%). Again, no distinct diﬀerence was observed be-\\ntween MR and LD, but 72% attended regular classes\\nin an ordinary school. Of 49 mentally retarded, 14% at-tended regular classes at ordinary schools; 27% attendedspecial classes at ordinary schools, and the remaining41% were at schools for handicapped, in institutions,or invalids at home.\\nOur purpose was to study the occurrence of LDs and\\ntheir eﬀects on medical and social outcomes and factors\\nthat might aﬀect outcome. We hypothesized that, even\\nin the long run, the outcome is not as favorable in thelearning disabled as in patients with no LD.\\n2. Subjects and methods\\nThe study group was derived from a population-\\nbased cohort. It included all children aged less than\\n16 years, who were resident in a geographically deﬁnedcatchment area of the University Central Hospital of\\nTurku at the end of 1964, had epilepsy [24–26] ,a n d\\nhad at least one epileptic seizure in 1961–1964 (‘‘activeepilepsy’’). In 1972, the cases were identiﬁed on the ba-sis of patient records of hospitals, institutions, daycarecenters, special schools, and private surgeons, as well\\nas of the National Health Service records, which cover\\nall citizens resident in Finland. The case identiﬁcation,made by one investigator only (M.S.), was very exten-sive, and continuing surveillance of the national registryrevealed only three patients who met the inclusion crite-ria but had not been included in the study. Based onthis recruitment procedure, altogether 245 patientscould be ascertained as patients who met the inclusion\\ncriteria.\\nThe cohort was followed for 45 years. Three patients\\ndied before the age of 3 and were considered too youngfor the assessment of LD. Thus, 242 patients (132 males,110 females) were available for the study. Data were col-lected retrospectively for the ﬁrst 10 years and then pro-spectively in examinations performed every ﬁfth year forthe last 35 years of follow-up. In 1992, after a total fol-\\nlow-up of 35 years, patients completed a detailed ques-\\ntionnaire and thorough face-to-face interview, physicalexamination, assessment of physical ﬁtness, and deter-mination of cardiovascular, liver, and bone marrowfunction and fat metabolism using clinical examinationand laboratory investigation. All the children were lessthan 16 years of age at the beginning of follow-up(mean, 4.7 years; range, 3–15). Follow-up extended to\\nthe year 2002 or to death. Fifty-seven patients died be-\\nfore 2002. The mean age at the end of follow-up was36 (range, 5–55) years. The study design, and some med-ical and social data, including social and educationaloutcomes by evolution of seizure status and medication,have been reported previously [19,27] .\\nThe Finnish Public Health Care Administration sys-\\ntem covers a child /C213s life from the fetal period to the\\nage of 16. Public health center districts, the smallest\\nadministrative units, constitute a countrywide network.A health care center includes a maternity health careclinic, children /C213s welfare clinic, and school health care\\norganization. In addition, municipal special child guid-ance clinics provide clinical, psychological, and similarservices. The public organization covers virtually 100%of children, and is capable of detecting any child with\\nhealth problems, including psychological problems, such\\nas a LD.\\nEpilepsy, types and etiology of seizures, and epilepsy\\nsyndromes have been deﬁned by the International Lea-gue Against Epilepsy [27]. Uncomplicated epilepsy is de-\\nﬁned as epilepsy without any additional neurologicalimpairments, such as cerebral palsy and MR [27]. Cere-\\nbral palsy is deﬁned as a chronic, nonprogressive cere-\\nbral disorder in young children that results in impaired\\nmotor function [28]. A subject is deﬁned as mentally938 M. Sillanpa ¨a¨/ Epilepsy & Behavior 5 (2004) 937–944normal and, accordingly, as having a normal intelligence\\nlevel (IQ > 85), if he or she had a normal cognitivedevelopment and accomplished acceptably in the main-stream school system (compulsory school for 7- to 16-year-olds) without any special or remedial education.A subject is considered near-normal if the IQ is 71–85\\nand he or she has received special education. Mentally\\nnormal and mentally near-normal are also called men-tally nonretarded. MR is deﬁned as a lifelong disordercharacterized by an inability to care for oneself like one /C213s\\npeers because of a low intelligence level (IQ < 70) untilthe age of 18 [29]. A subject is deﬁned as mildly mentally\\nretarded if his or her IQ is 50–70, and severely mentallyretarded patients if the IQ is <50. Socioeconomic status\\nis deﬁned according to the criteria of the Central Statis-\\ntical Oﬃce of Finland [30]. Passing a Finnish matricula-\\ntion examination is approximately equal to passing theﬁrst university year in the United States [27].\\nSevere MR is clinically obvious but was assessed by\\na clinical psychologist in most cases. Test results (ver-bal, performance, total) were available in the patient re-cords. Virtually all mildly mentally retarded patients\\nwere assessed on clinical grounds, and in most cases\\nseveral times, by a psychologist, because a psycholo-gist /C213s statement was necessary for public special educa-\\ntion services, and the mainstream schools did not haveto accept mentally retarded pupils for education with-out the psychological assessment and subsequent extraresources for classroom teaching. A subject had a spe-ciﬁc LD, if he or she, even though able to read, write,\\nand calculate, had speciﬁc diﬃculties in learning these\\nskills, was an overall slow learner, or had any otherlearning diﬃculty requiring special education any timeat school. Again, for school administrative reasons, vir-tually all these children were assessed by a psychologist.We also had detailed data on their primary and voca-tional education, later working history, reproductiveactivity, licensure for driving, and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. However, for certainty reasons, the 35-year fol-\\nlow-up questionnaire included a question ‘‘Have youever (at school age or later) had diﬃculties in reading,writing, or language?’’ In addition, at the same time,participants were clinically assessed by one and thesame experienced clinician using a structured studyform for motor dysfunction, language diﬃculties, atten-tion deﬁcits, LD, behavioral problems, special school\\neducation, and school achievements. All the patients\\nwho had a LD had had it since school years; none ofthem had a LD of acquired origin.\\nFor statistical analyses, Pearson /C213sv\\n2test with Fischer\\nexact test (two-tail) and Yates /C213s correction when appro-\\npriate were used for univariate analyses, Mann–Whitneytest for continuing variable comparisons, and stepwiselogistic regression analysis for multivariate analyses\\nand odds ratios and relative risks. Computations were\\ncarried out using SAS statistical software. Pvalues<0.05 were interpreted as statistically signiﬁcant. The\\nJoint Ethics Review Committee of the Turku UniversityMedical School and the Turku University Central Hos-pital approved the study design.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Occurrence\\nOne-fourth (24%) of 242 patients had no LD whatso-\\never. One hundred and eighty-two (76%) had some typeof LD to some degree. The occurrence was very signiﬁ-cantly bound to the intelligence level. LDs occurred in\\n57% of subjects with an IQ greater than 85, in 67% of\\nthose with an IQ of 71–85, and, self-evidently, in 100%of the mentally retarded. Half of the patients (51%) withLDs had MR. Of all subjects, 78% attended regular clas-ses at ordinary schools, 12% attended special classes atordinary schools, 9% attended training schools for men-tally handicapped, and the remaining 1% attended othertypes of schools. Reading, writing, and speech problems\\nin mentally nonretarded patients occurred transiently or\\nmostly permanently in 19, 19, and 40%, respectively.Subjects with near-normal intelligence (IQ 71–85) hadsigniﬁcantly more often than mentally normal patientsreceived special education (45% vs 3%, P< 0.0001)\\nand failed to pass compulsory school (10% vs 0%,P= 0.035). The mentally near-normal subjects also\\nhad hyperkinetic features in their behavior more often\\nthan the mentally normal subjects (44% vs 8%,\\nP< 0.0001). Compared with nonretarded subjects with\\nother types of epilepsy, reading disability occurred lessoften in those with rolandic epilepsy ( P= 0.0122,\\nRR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.02–1.08), but more often inthose with minor motor seizures (West syndrome andLennox–Gastaut syndrome) ( P= 0.0322, RR = 2.73,\\n95% CI = 1.64–4.60). The incidence of writing diﬃcul-\\nties did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer by epilepsy type. Speech\\ndisorders were more often associated with temporal lobeepilepsy ( P= 0.0289, RR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.15–3.73)\\nand epilepsy with minor motor seizures ( P< 0.0001,\\nRR = 4.70, 95% CI = 3.37–6.57).\\nOne hundred patients had uncomplicated epilepsy.\\nNineteen (19%) with uncomplicated epilepsy reportedreading problems, 18% writing diﬃculties, and 15%\\nspeech problems at school age and/or later. LD oc-\\ncurred signiﬁcantly less often in patients with rolandicepilepsy than in patients with other types of epilepsy(6% vs 35%, P= 0.0122), and speech problems more of-\\nten in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than othertypes of epilepsy (37% vs 18%, P= 0.0289, RR = 2.7,\\n95% CI = 1.19–6.15) compared with controls. LD wasnot signiﬁcantly more common among subjects with\\ntemporal lobe epilepsy than among controls ( P=\\n0.0742, RR = 1.95, 95% CI = 0.93–4.07).M. Sillanpa ¨a¨/ Epilepsy & Behavior 5 (2004) 937–944 9393.2. Predictors of occurrence\\nIn univariate analysis, signiﬁcant predictors of the\\noccurrence of MR included cerebral palsy, poor early ef-fect of drug therapy, early (<6 years) onset of epilepsy,and status epilepticus ( Table 1 ). A stepwise logistic\\nregression analysis of the signiﬁcant single determinants\\nshowed that independent predictors of the occurrence ofMR and subsequent LD were cerebral palsy (OR = 3.83,95% CI = 1.77–8.28, P= 0.0006), onset of epilepsy be-\\nfore the age of (3.63, 1.57–8.42, P= 0.0026), and poor\\nearly eﬀect of drug therapy (2.78, 1.43–5.39, P= 0.0025).\\nIn univariate analysis, among the mentally nonre-\\ntarded subjects, symptomatic etiology of epilepsy, con-\\ncomitant cerebral palsy, and poor early eﬀect of drug\\ntherapy were signiﬁcantly associated with LD, closely,but statistically nonsigniﬁcantly, followed by status epi-lepticus, male sex, and MR in relatives ( Table 2 ). In\\nmultivariate analysis between the signiﬁcant predictors,a symptomatic etiology of epilepsy was the only predic-\\ntor of the occurrence of LD in mentally nonretarded pa-tients (OR = 7.72, 95% CI = 3.02–19.76).\\n3.3. Seizure outcome\\nLD of any kind and seizure outcome are closely inter-\\nrelated. Table 3 shows that 90% of mentally normal sub-\\njects with no LD, approximately 70% of mentallynormal subjects with LD, and 54% of the mentally re-tarded subjects achieved 5-year or longer seizure-freeperiods at any stage of follow-up (remission ever),whether on medication or not. Intelligence level didnot determine seizure outcome among either the men-\\ntally retarded or the nonretarded subjects.\\nWith respect to the occurrence of relapses, again, pa-\\ntients with any degree of MR and those with any LD,regardless of MR, relapsed signiﬁcantly more often thanothers ( Table 4 ). The relapse rate was very high among\\nTable 1\\nPredictors of the occurrence of mental retardation among adult patients with childhood-onset epilepsy\\nPredictor Mental retardation P OR 95% CI\\nN Yes No\\nn % n %\\nCerebral palsy <0.0001\\nNo 189 54 28.6 135 71.4 1.0Yes 53 38 71.7 15 28.3 6.33 3.22–12.45\\nPoor early drug eﬀect <0.0001\\nNo 131 38 29.0 93 71.0 1.0\\nYes 75 43 57.3 32 42.7 3.29 1.82–5.95\\nOnset of epilepsy <0.0001\\n>6 years 66 12 18.2 54 81.8 1.0\\n66 years 176 80 45.4 96 54.6 3.75 1.88–7.49\\nStatus epilepticus 0.0151\\nNo 167 55 32.9 112 67.1 1.0\\nYes 75 37 49.3 38 50.7 1.98 1.14–3.46\\nGender 0.1385\\nFemale 112 37 33.0 75 67.0 1.0Male 130 55 42.3 75 57.7 1.49 0.88–2.51\\nEpilepsy type 0.6093\\nAll but TLE 160 59 36.9 101 63.1 1.0TLE 88 33 40.2 49 59.8 1.15 0.67–1.99\\nTable 2Predictors of learning disability in 149 nonretarded patients with childhood-onset epilepsy\\nPredictor N LD (%) P OR 95% CI\\nEtiology of epilepsy <0.0001\\nIdiopathic 68 64.7 1.0\\nCryptogenic 54 51.8 0.59 0.28–1.22\\nSymptomatic 120 93.3 7.64 3.19–18.28\\nCerebral palsy 53 92.4 0.0015 4.90 1.69–14.24Poor early drug eﬀect 75 88.0 0.0026 3.22 1.46–7.10\\nStatus epilepticus 75 84.0 0.0517 2.00 0.99–4.04\\nMale sex 130 80.8 0.0630 1.75 0.97–3.23MR in relatives 46 84.8 0.1353 1.93 0.81–4.62Onset of epilepsy <6 years 137 77.8 0.2820 1.43 0.75–2.70\\nTemporal lobe epilepsy 82 78.1 0.5990 1.19 0.63–2.22940 M.

Social outcome\\nEleven percent of the patients with LD but normal\\nintelligence and 33% of those with near-normal intelli-\\ngence were pensioned for employment disability\\n(P= 0.0214). One percent of mentally normal and 10%\\nof mentally near-normal subjects were independent(P= 0.0960). Among mentally retarded people, depen-\\ndency in daily activities increased signiﬁcantly(P= 0.0001) with decreasing mental level: of patients\\nwith mild, moderate, severe, or profound mental retar-dation, 11, 20, 60, and 100%, respectively, were com-\\npletely or virtually completely dependent in activities\\nof daily living. The corresponding ﬁgures for occasionalor permanent institutionalization were 20, 53, 81, and95%.One-fourth of controls but almost half the subjects\\nwith uncomplicated epilepsy but normal intelligenceand almost 90% of those with near-normal intelligencehad had to settle for primary education only or less thanprimary education ( Table 5 ). The risks of unemploy-\\nment, living single, and having no children were higheramong near-normal than normal subjects. Except forone person who had a special college education, none\\nof the mentally retarded subjects, though not exempted\\nfrom compulsory education, could pass the matricula-tion examination. The lower the intelligence level, thegreater the risk of not passing. The same trend couldbe seen throughout the line: the intellectually less advan-taged had in fewer cases vocational training, paid work,a partner, or children. Interestingly, roughly the samepercentages of controls and subjects with epilepsy only\\npassed the matriculation examination. Similarly, socio-\\neconomic status did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer between thetwo groups.\\n4. Discussion and conclusions\\nIn our population-based, unselected study, 76% of\\nsubjects had at least one mild to severe learning disabil-\\nity. Half of the patients had MR, and the other half,near-normal to normal intelligence.

Patients with epilepsyare generally considered to be at a threefold risk for cog-nitive or other mental problems [31]. Our results are in\\nkeeping with these data. In another study of ours in1987, all the parents of children aged 8 to 9 years fromordinary schools in the same area as the study patientsreported one or more LDs in 15–20% and their teachers\\nin 31% (unpublished data). Interestingly, the LD rate\\nwas exactly the same in a recent study of 11-year-oldschoolchildren in the same city [32]. A speciﬁc LD has\\nbeen reported in 10 to 21% of adults with TLE [33].\\nThe ﬁgure is essentially the same as in our patients withuncomplicated epilepsy of any type. Of speciﬁc LDs,reading disability occurred in our sample signiﬁcantlymore often in subjects with West syndrome or Len-\\nnox–Gastaut syndrome, but signiﬁcantly less often in\\nsubjects with rolandic epilepsy compared with other epi-lepsy types. Speech diﬃculties are known to be associ-ated with epilepsy- [34]related LD either transiently or\\nconstantly [35–37] . In our study, the risk associated with\\nuncomplicated epilepsy was 2.7-fold.\\nReasons for LD among patients with epilepsy are\\nprobably the direct eﬀects of seizures, particularly in\\nchildren with early age of onset, processes behind the\\nepilepsy syndrome, eﬀects of concomitant and often pre-ceding neuropsychological deﬁcits, adverse eﬀects ofdrug therapy, and social stigma [38]. A less favorable so-\\ncial outcome of mentally near-normal may be preferablyexplained by a virtually lower performance potential.However, one cannot exclude the possible eﬀect of socialstigma on the less successful future of mentally normal\\nadults with uncomplicated epilepsy in childhood. Socie-\\ntal misunderstanding and generalization of all peoplewith epilepsy as the same [39]by families [40], educators[41], other people with epilepsy [42], and even patients\\nthemselves have though unintended, eﬀects such as so-cial and educational displacement and omission. Our re-sults might indicate this eﬀect; more subjects thanexpected had a compulsory primary education only,but if they did proceed with education, they passed thenext academic step, the matriculation examination, vir-tually as often as controls. Epilepsy is a stigma in Wes-\\ntern societies [43,44] , and an invisible handicap is an\\neven more labeling factor [45]. Epilepsy and LD pose\\na challenge for our time to minimize the eﬀects of boththe medical and social disadvantages of epilepsy [34].\\nOur study is one of the few population-based analy-\\nses of LD among both mentally retarded and mentallynormal or near-normal patients with epilepsy. The per-centage of mentally retarded in the present study\\n(38%) is well in line with the previous studies (range,\\n33–54%) [11,12,15–18,46] . MR was more common\\namong our patients with prevalent cases (55%) thanamong those with incident cases (25%) [22]. The ﬁgures\\nof Camﬁeld et al. [23], which were lower than those in\\nthe previous studies and in our study both for mentalretardation and LD among children with normal intelli-gence, are explained largely by their diﬀerent study pop-\\nulation. Furthermore, in the Camﬁeld et al. study, the\\nyoungest patients might have been too young for assess-ment, and the actual LD rate might therefore be higher.\\nThe present study demonstrates a relationship be-\\ntween low cognitive function and poor seizure outcome.Although some authors have not found any diﬀerence inoutcome related to the severity of intellectual disability,several others have reported such a relationship\\n[3,5,6,15,16,22,47,48] . An association of cerebral palsy\\nwith epilepsy increased the prevalence of mental retarda-tion up to 41% in our patients.

Sillanpa ¨a¨/ Epilepsy & Behavior 5 (2004) 937–944have been reported [3,11,12,17,49,50] . The risk of the co-\\noccurrence of LD with epilepsy increases with increasingseverity of cognitive deﬁcit. However, in our subjectswith normal intelligence (IQ > 85), LD was more com-mon than in controls. The same observation has been re-ported both in adults [51]and in children [52,53] , whose\\nmemory function in particular has been vulnerable.\\nIn line with our study, early age at onset of epilepsy is\\nan indicator of poor seizure outcome in LD, particularlyin severe LD [50,54] . Furthermore, the higher rate of re-\\nlapses in patients with MR than in the mentally normalwas conﬁrmed [18,22,48,55] .\\nSocial and educational outcomes are aﬀected by LD.\\nLess basic and vocational education, fewer marriages\\nand children, higher rate of disability pension for unﬁt\\nto work, and higher rate of institutionalization have alsobeen reported in previous studies [18,56] . Intellectual\\ndeﬁcits are of greater importance than personality dis-turbances in social adjustment [48].\\nIn conclusion, learning disability is a common feature\\nof patients with childhood-onset epilepsy of any kindand aﬀects medical, social, and educational outcomes.\\nPoor seizure outcome and learning disability occur more\\noften than expected in epileptic subjects who are men-tally normal, followed by mentally near-normal andmentally retarded subjects. Although the social conse-quences may be in part related to social stigma, thereis no doubt that biological factors play an importantrole in adjustment and social accomplishment. Futureprospective population-based studies should be designed\\nto evaluate how much the causative factors diﬀer be-\\ntween these subgroups and how well progress in moderndiagnostic technology and antiepileptic drug develop-ment and improvement in public attitudes may decreaselearning problems in people with epilepsy.\\nReferences\\n[1] Keating LE.

Factors\\nthat lead to such problems in children with epilepsy, however , are not well under-\\nstood. Exploring these factors is important because academic underachievement canlead to poor social outcomes and contribute to underemployment or unemployment in\\nadulthood. This descriptive, cross-sectional study investigated a group of children\\nwho had been diagnosed with seizures approximately 12 months previously, providingthe opportunity to describe relationships among family and child characteristics;parent, child, and teacher responses; and child academic achievement at the same\\npoint in time across the sample. Seventy-two children had standardized test total\\nbattery scores, 101 had a teacher’s rating of performance, and 67 had scores for both.Data were analyzed using multivariable regression. Child adaptive competency and\\nseizure severity were associated with higher teacher ratings of academic performance\\n(b= 0.73, p<0.0001 and b= 2.38, p= 0.0182, respectively). Child adaptive compe-\\ntency was associated with higher total battery scores ( b= 0.73, p<0.0001). Contrary\\nto ﬁndings in studies of children with chronic epilepsy, mean academic achievement in\\nthis sample of children with recent-onset seizures was in the average range; however ,25% of the children were at or below one standard deviation below the mean on theteacher’s rating of performance and 10% on the total battery. It is therefore important\\nfor health professionals and educators to regularly assess the child’s academic\\nfunctioning and school performance to identify those at risk for problems. Healthprofessionals and educators need to collaborate on assessment and interventions to\\nhelp maximize child academic success.\\n#2005 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

No reported studies haveinvestigated academic performance in childrenwith recent-onset seizures, although such a sample\\ncould yield data important to guide intervention and\\nprevention efforts.\\nThis descriptive, cross-sectional study examined\\na group of children who had been diagnosed withseizures approximately 12 months previously, pro-viding the opportunity to describe relationshipsamong family and child characteristics; childresponses; and child academic achievement at the\\nsame point in time across the sample. Because this\\nis a population that has been understudied andabout which relatively little is known, we did nothypothesize effects of these factors on the outcomevariables; rather , the intent was to describe rela-tionships in this unique sample.\\nThe double ABCX model of family adjustment\\n8\\nwas used as a source theory for the study. This model\\nhas been used in prior research by Austin and col-\\nleagues to help explain psychosocial factors relatedto adjustment in children with epilepsy andasthma.\\n9,10The model considers adaptive resources\\nand perceptions of or responses to a chronic healthcondition as factors in adaptation to the condition.Relevant to the current study, included in adapta-tion is the degree to which a child performs satis-\\nfactorily in school and is able to meet the demands\\nof the academic environment. The theoreticalmodel used in this study ( Fig. 1 ) combined factors\\nfrom the double ABCX model and other variablesfrom the literature shown to be associated withacademic achievement in epilepsy; however , thedegree of proximity of these variables to child aca-demic achievement was not hypothesized. We con-\\nsidered both illness and psychosocial factors in\\ndetermining their relationships to academicachievement in a group of children with recent-onset seizures. The etiology of achievement pro-blems is likely the result of many variables. Amongthose, the variables most relevant to this studyinclude family characteristics (socioeconomic statusand family resources), child characteristics (illnesscharacteristics, age, gender), and child responses\\n(attitude toward illness, school self-concept, adap-tive competency, and internalizing behavior).\\nFamily characteristics measured in this study\\nwere socioeconomic status (SES) and familyresources. In the general population, SES is stronglyassociated with educational accomplishments andattainment in children.\\n11,12Verna and Campbell13\\nfound that SES had an indirect in ﬂuence on achieve-\\nment in gifted children since high-SES families havethe ﬁnancial capital to provide intellectual\\nresources that can promote achievement.\\n13Speci ﬁc\\nto epilepsy, but not to achievement, Mitchell et al.3\\nfound that level of parental education was amongthe best SES predictors of IQ in a group of 78 childrenwith epilepsy. Family resources appear to play an\\nimportant role in buffering the untoward effects of\\nepilepsy on child academic achievement. Austinet al.\\n10,14found in a study of family characteristics\\nof children with epilepsy and behavior problemsthat children with the most problems came fromfamilies with low family mastery.\\nChild characteristics , including illness variables,\\nage, and gender , have been studied in relation to\\nacademic underachievement in children with epi-\\nlepsy in past studies, but ﬁndings have been mixed.\\nLonger duration of the condition,\\n15higher seizure\\nfrequency,15—18and younger age at onset of seizures\\nhave been associated with higher rates of academicunderachievement.\\n19—21Huberty et al.22and Mitch-\\nell and colleagues,3however , found no relationship\\nbetween seizure variables and achievement in\\nchildren with epilepsy. Younger age at onset of332 A.M. McNelis et al.\\nFigure 1 Predictive model of academic achievement in\\nchildren with seizures.seizures has been associated with higher rates of\\nacademic underachievement.19,21,23 —25Older chil-\\ndren were found to be further behind in theirachievement levels in word recognition, spelling,arithmetic, and reading comprehension thanyounger children.\\n20Bailet and Turk,26however ,\\nfound no relationship between age at onset andneurocognitive scores. Gender differences also have\\nbeen found, with some studies reporting better\\nadaptation and academic achievement for femalesthan for males with epilepsy.\\n2,27In a recent study of\\nchildren with chronic epilepsy, Austin et al.10also\\nfound that males were more at risk for academicunderachievement than females. In the Howe andcolleagues\\n28study, however , adolescent males both\\nwith and without neurological conditions scored\\nsigni ﬁcantly higher on the knowledge subscale of\\nthe Woodcock —Johnson psychoeducational battery\\nthan adolescent females. Finally, studies by Mat-thews et al.,\\n29Williams et al.;17and Rutter et al.4\\nfound no differences in the achievement of childrenwith seizures based on gender.\\nChild response variables, including attitudes\\ntoward the illness, school self-concept, adaptive\\ncompetency, and internalizing behavior problems,\\nwere hypothesized in the model to be associatedwith academic achievement. Austin and collea-gues\\n10found that children ’s negative attitudes\\ntoward their condition were signi ﬁcantly related\\nto poorer academic achievement both in childrenwith epilepsy and in those with asthma. Mboya\\n30\\nfound that a positive global self-concept and, more\\nstrongly, a positive self-concept of academic ability\\nwere signi ﬁcantly related to academic achieve-\\nment. Although this ﬁnding is consistent with the\\ntheory that students ’perceptions in ﬂuence the\\ndirection, strength, and persistence of theirachievement behaviors,\\n31the correlation study\\ncould not show causal directions. Only two reportedstudies have examined school-related perceptions\\nin children with epilepsy, and neither of these\\nincluded children with recent-onset seizures. Com-pared with matched samples of children with dia-betes or healthy controls, children with epilepsy hadsigni ﬁcantly poorer self-concepts related to intel-\\nlectual functioning, were more worried about test-ing in school, and were more nervous about having ateacher call on them.\\n32Moreover , the parents of the\\nchildren with epilepsy reported that their children\\nhad fewer positive feelings about school comparedto the other two groups.\\nThe relationship between behavior problems and\\nunderachievement has been strong across researchstudies. Rapport et al.\\n33found that internalizing\\nproblems, particularly anxiety/depression andwithdrawal, contributed to prediction of children ’sclassroom performance. Several studies have shown\\nwithdrawal to be related to lower academic ratingsinﬁrst and second grade\\n34and to lower scores on\\nstandardized achievement tests.35Related to this,\\nAustin and colleagues10found that teachers ’ratings\\nof poorer school adaptive competency (i.e., howhard the child is working, appropriate behavior ,overall happiness, and how well the child is learn-\\ning) were signi ﬁcantly associated with poorer aca-\\ndemic achievement in children with epilepsy.\\nPurpose\\nAlthough these associations have been studied inthe past, the samples were general populationchildren or children with chronic conditions. There-\\nfore, the purpose of this study was to identify the\\nassociation of these selected variables to academicachievement in children with recent-onset seizures.The overall research question was, ‘‘What family\\ncharacteristics (socioeconomic status and familyresources), child characteristics (illness character-istics, age, gender), and child responses (attitudetoward illness, school self-concept, adaptive com-\\npetency, and internalizing behavior) are related to\\nchild academic achievement? ’’\\nMethods\\nResearch design\\nData presented are from a larger study of adaptation\\nto childhood epilepsy in 106 children ages 8 —15\\nyears, 57 males and 49 males. Data collected at 1year after onset of the ﬁrst seizure were used for the\\ncurrent study. We chose to use 12-month databecause the period immediately after the ﬁrst sei-\\nzure typically involves months of diagnostic assess-ment and adjustment. The children ’s conditions\\nhave stabilized fairly well by 1 year , making that\\na good time to measure how they are performingacademically. We wanted the teachers ’ratings and\\nthe standardized test scores to re ﬂect a stable but\\nearly stage of the child ’s seizure condition. Data\\nwere collected through structured telephone inter-views with each parent and child and mailed ques-tionnaires to teachers.\\nParticipants were children with recent-onset sei-\\nzures and their major care-giving parent (72 chil-dren had total battery scores, 101 had a teacher ’s\\nrating of performance, and 67 had scores for both).See Table 1 for a description of the sample. To be\\nincluded in this analysis, children had to meet thefollowing criteria: (a) between the ages of 8 and 15years; (b) 12 months since ﬁrst recognized seizure-Factors associated with academic achievement in children with recent-onset seizures 333like episode; (c) no other chronic medical conditions\\nrequiring long-term care, such as diabetes; (d) par-ent report that child was not mentally handicappedor school records documenting normal intelligence;\\nand (e) no sibling with a chronic medical condition.\\nThe children were recruited from emergency rooms,outpatient pediatric clinics, private neurologists,and EEG laboratories at two sites: Indianapolis,IN, and Memphis, TN.\\nInstrumentation\\nFamily characteristicsSocioeconomic status was collected from the\\nmother and measured using a method that combined\\nmother ’s education and the occupation of the head\\nof the household to create one score.\\n36This measure\\nhas been found to be a valid and reliable indicator ofSES in the prediction of health behavior.\\n9A higher\\nscore represents higher SES, and the mean for thissample of 61.1 represents an average or mid-rangescore. Family resources were measured using\\nselected items from the family inventory of\\nresources for management (FIRM).\\n37The original\\nFIRM was a 69-item self-report instrument thatprovided information on the family ’s repertoire of\\nresources in four areas: esteem and communication;mastery and health; extended family social support;and ﬁnancial well-being. Items selected for the\\ncurrent study were from the mastery and health\\nsubscale, which measures personal, family system\\nand social support resources. Parents responded to20 items on 4-point scales of 0 ( not at all )t o3( very\\nwell ). Validity and reliability have been strong in\\nprevious research, and subscales of the FIRM havebeen correlated with changes in child behavior. Themastery and health subscale showed strong internalconsistency reliability in this study (coef ﬁcient\\na= 0.95).\\nChild characteristics\\nPreliminary analyses showed no correlations betweenduration of condition, seizure frequency, or age ofonset of seizures and the outcome variables, so these\\nvariables were not included in the model. The illnesscharacteristic used was seizure severity and wascalculated to categorize the children with seizures\\ninto three groups: one seizure, controlled seizures,\\nand uncontrolled seizures. Children were placed inthe one-seizure group if they had experienced onlyone seizure and had not been placed on medication(n= 20). Children in the controlled group had experi-\\nenced one seizure, had been placed on medica-tion(s), and had had no further seizures ( n=1 5 ) .\\nThe children in the uncontrolled seizure group had\\nexperienced more than one seizure. This group\\nincluded children regardless of their medication sta-tus ( n= 71). This grouping provides the severity rat-\\nings used in the analyses, ranging from 1 (leastsevere) to 3 (most severe). The seizure information,as well as the child ’s age (to nearest month) and\\ngender , were collected from parents and medicalrecords. Although it was recognized that medications\\ncould affect some of the variables, the large number\\nof combinations of therapeutic level, dosage, type,and duration of medications precluded considerationof them in the model. Moreover , bivariate correla-tions between medications and outcome variableswere not statistically signi ﬁcant.\\nChild response\\nVariables selected to re ﬂect child response were\\nattitude, school self-concept, internalizing beha-vior problems, and adaptive competency. Child atti-tude was measured using the child attitude towardillness scale (CATIS).\\n38The CATIS is a 13-item scale\\nproviding information on how children feel abouthaving a particular health condition. Children\\nresponded to 9 statements on 5-point scales of 1\\n(never )t o5( very often ) and 4 statements on 5-point\\nscales such as 1 ( very fair )t o5( very unfair ). The\\nscale had good reliability ( a= 0.81) in this study. A\\ntotal score was used in the analyses, with higherscores representing more positive attitudes. Schoolself-concept was measured using a 17-item subscaleof the Piers —Harris self-concept scale (PH).\\n39Chil-334 A.M.

The scale had good reliability(a= 0.78) in this study.\\nChild internalizing behavior was measured using\\nthe parent ’s report from the child behavior check-\\nlist (CBCL).\\n40For each item, parents used 3-point\\nscales from 0 ( not true )t o2( very or often true )t o\\nindicate how true each behavioral description hadbeen for the child over the past 6 months. The CBCLprovides separate scores for the subdimensions ofinternalizing and externalizing behavior , as wellas for total problems. The internalizing behaviorscore used in the analyses re ﬂects problems within\\nthe self, such as anxiety, depression, somatic com-\\nplaints without a known medical cause, and with-drawal\\n40with higher scores representing more\\nproblems.\\nChild adaptive competency was measured using\\nteachers ’ratings from the teacher ’s report form\\n(TRF).41For each item, teachers used 7-point scales\\nfrom 1 ( much less )t o7( much more ) to indicate how\\ntrue each description is for the child compared to\\ntypical pupils of the same age. The total adaptivecompetency score measures the child ’s overall hap-\\npiness, how well the child is learning, appropriatebehavior , and how hard the child is working atschool. Higher values re ﬂect more competencies\\nor adaptive functioning.\\nChild academic achievement was measured using\\ntwo methods: the teacher ’s rating of performance\\n(TRP) and a school-administered standardizedachievement test total battery score (TB). TheTRP was collected using the teacher ’s report\\nform.\\n41This score is based on the teacher ’s ratings\\nof classroom performance in 6 academic subjectareas on a scale from 1 ( far below grade level )t o5\\n(far above grade ) and summed to create a total\\nscore that re ﬂects overall performance. Baseline\\nschool performance was obtained prior to the onsetof the health condition. Follow-up data wereobtained from the child ’s current teacher at 12\\nand 24 months. The norm for the TRP is a standardT-score of 50 and standard deviation of 10.\\nTB scores from school-administered standar-\\ndized tests completed by the children during the\\nacademic year at school were used. Although dif-\\nferent standardized tests were utilized by the var-ious school systems, the majority used one of thefollowing: the Indiana statewide testing for educa-tional progress (ISTEP), the comprehensive test ofbasic skills (CTBS), the Iowa test of basic skills(ITBS) or the California achievement tests (CAT).The content of these types of school-administeredachievement tests are similar across grades and the\\nscores tend to be highly correlated. Additionally,because these tests are nationally normed andbased on a normal distribution, direct comparabil-ity is allowed. The tests provide information aboutspeci ﬁc academic skills and re ﬂect the curriculum\\nused in the schools. The tests include measures ofbasic academic skills, such as reading, language,\\nand math, as well as a total composite score (total\\nbattery) that is an overall measure of achievement.It is the latter score that was used in analyses. Thenorm for the total battery is a standard T-score of\\n50 and standard deviation of 10. The TB, like theTRP , also re ﬂects overall academic performance;\\nhowever , it is less subjective than the teachers ’\\nratings of performance. The percentiles for the TB\\nscores were converted to standard T-scores with a\\nmean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, usingnational norms because parametric statistics arenot appropriate methods of analysis for percentiledata. Because of the restricted testing schedule inschools (children do not undergo testing at everygrade level), not all children have test results at alltimes.\\nResults\\nThe primary analysis was a multivariable regressionof nine variables: age, gender , seizure severity, SES,FIRM mastery and health, CATIS, Piers —Harris school\\nself-concept, CBCL internalizing problems score,\\nand the adaptive functioning score, on the teacher ’s\\nrating of academic performance. Descriptive statis-tics for these variables are shown in Table 1 . These\\nvariables accounted for a moderately large amountof the variance in teachers ’ratings of achievement\\n(adjusted R\\n2= 0.529).\\nAcademic performance was signi ﬁcantly asso-\\nciated with seizure severity ( p= 0.0182) and the\\nadaptive functioning score ( p<0.0001). The bfor\\nseizure severity is positive, indicating that childrenwith a more severe seizure condition do better onthe teachers ’ratings of achievement. This appears\\nto be a result of low TRP scores for the group ofchildren with a seizure severity score of 2. Themean academic achievement score for childrenwith a severity of 2 is 45.13 with a standard devia-\\ntion of 10.51. Seven of these 15 children scored at\\nor below one standard deviation below the nationalmean on the teacher ’s rating of performance. The\\nmean TRP for children with seizure severity of 1 is49.65 with a standard deviation of 7.22, and forchildren with a severity of 3 the mean is 48.91 witha standard deviation of 9.91. The sample sizes forthis analysis were small ( n= 17, 15, and 69 for the 3Factors associated with academic achievement in children with recent-onset seizures 335severity groups, respectively), so cautious interpre-\\ntation is recommended. The bfor adaptive func-\\ntioning is also positive, which indicates that higherchild adaptive functioning is associated withhigher teacher ratings of academic performance.The result of this regression analysis is shown inTable 2 .\\nAs a secondary analysis, multivariable regression\\nwas done on the children ’s total academic battery\\ntest scores. A fair amount of the variance in thetotal battery scores was explained by these ninevariables (adjusted R\\n2= 0.362). The adaptive\\nfunctioning score was signi ﬁcantly associated with\\nbattery scores ( p<0.0001). Children with higher\\nadaptive functioning performed better on the\\nbattery. Gender and SES were borderline statisti-\\ncally signi ﬁcantly associated with Total Battery\\n(p= 0.0783 and 0.0800, respectively). The trends\\nwere for children with a higher SES and females toscore higher on the battery. These results areshown in Table 3 .\\nInitial examination of the teachers ’ratings of\\nperformance indicated that this sample was per-\\nforming slightly below average ( M= 48.5,\\nS.D. = 9.6), with 23 of the 101 children (22.8%)scoring at or below one standard deviation belowthe national mean. In contrast, academic achieve-ment outcomes showed that this sample was per-forming slightly above the national average on the\\ntotal battery score ( M= 54.6, S.D. = 11.0). Only 12\\nof the 72 children (16.7%) scored at or below onestandard deviation below the national mean.\\nAnalyses were conducted on the subsample of\\nchildren who scored at or below one standard devia-tion below the mean (28 [27.8%] on the TRP and 9\\n[12.5%] on the TB) to explore the relationships\\namong variables in the low-achieving students. Onthe TRP , scores for this subsample ranged from 35 to38, with 13 (56.5%) scoring 35. The subsample on theTB had scores ranging from 27 to 40. Of the 67children who had both achievement scores, theaverage difference between the total battery andteachers ’ratings scores was 5.31, which is approxi-\\nmately 1/2 standard deviation of difference\\nbetween the two measures of achievement. Over-all, the teachers ’ratings were slightly lower than\\nthe standardized achievement score. Additionally,the total battery score and the teachers ’ratings of\\nperformance were moderately well correlated(R\\n2= 0.65, p<0.0001) for the total sample. There-\\nfore, teachers ’ratings were used in the primary\\nanalyses. Because the subsample size was relatively\\nsmall, correlational analyses rather than regressionanalyses were conducted using all of the variables inthe model. None of the correlations were statisti-cally signi ﬁcant.336 A.M.

It was\\nexpected that child adaptive competency (i.e.,working hard, behaving appropriately, happy, andlearning) would be related to child academic\\nachievement, and this variable was strongly corre-\\nlated with both teacher ratings of performance andchild performance on the total battery. This ﬁnding\\nis important because teachers ’ratings are a rela-\\ntively more subjective measure of performance andthe total battery is an objective standardized test,yet both are predicted by this same factor . In chil-dren with chronic epilepsy, Austin and colleagues\\n10\\nalso found that lower adaptive competency wasassociated with poorer academic achievement.These ﬁndings support the need for assessment\\nand intervention for children who are having dif ﬁ-\\nculties in areas related to work effort, behavior ,learning, and happiness. Findings also strongly sug-gest that teachers should be involved in the assess-ment and treatment of children with epilepsy.\\nNurses should educate teachers on the capabilities\\nand behaviors of children with epilepsy. Moreover ,nurses need to educate teachers on how their atti-tudes can in ﬂuence performance and how to be\\nmore supportive and encouraging for children whoare at risk.\\n42\\nThe ﬁnding that seizure severity was strongly\\nassociated with teacher ratings of academic\\nachievement is consistent with several studies.15—18\\nIn our study, a large component of severity was\\nfrequency, and past studies have shown a relation-ship between seizure frequency and academic pro-blems.\\n22,25Subtle changes related to the seizures\\nand treatment that affect the child ’s classroom\\nperformance on a daily basis, such as fatigue, atten-tion, and memory problems, may be identi ﬁed by\\nthe more frequent teacher assessments. It might be\\nthat teacher ratings of performance are more sen-sitive to detecting change in a child ’s academic\\nperformance than are standardized achievementtests, a possible explanation for why severity wasnot associated with total battery scores in this study.Again, the TRP measures classroom grades thatreﬂect how the child is currently performing, so\\ndecline can be detected early.\\nThe third major ﬁnding was that most children\\nwere performing in the average range on both theteacher ratings of performance and the school-administered standardized achievement total bat-tery tests. This ﬁnding is similar to Williams and\\ncolleagues ’\\n43study in which children with con-\\ntrolled epilepsy were found to have verbal IQ, aca-demic skill development, and verbal memory skills\\nwithin the average range. Similarly, Austin et al.44\\nfound that the achievement of children with inac-tive or low-severity epilepsy was comparable tonational norms. So while children with epilepsyare at risk for academic problems, ﬁndings from\\nthis study indicate that these problems, in general,do not manifest within the ﬁrst year following diag-\\nnosis. It should be noted, however , that there were\\nsome children who were already scoring belowaverage on both measure of academic performance.Future studies need to follow a sample with new-onset seizures for a longer period of time to explorefactors associated with poor performance, to exam-ine change in achievement over time, and identifywhen academic problems develop.\\nAlso important was the ﬁnding that teacher rat-\\nings of performance and the total battery scoreswere signi ﬁcantly correlated. Standardized testing\\nis not completed at each grade level in school, andthisﬁnding shows that teacher ratings can be used as\\na fairly reliable measure of academic performancewhen standardized scores are not available. More-over , teachers can make frequent assessments and\\nclosely monitor changes in performance using the\\nTRP , whereas standardized testing in the school doesnot occur often enough to identify these changes.\\nLimitations of the study include potential con-\\nfounding of data collected from the teachers onratings of academic performance and adaptive func-tioning; however , the standardized test scoresreduce the concern because those are not assessed\\nby the teacher. Additionally, the use of standardized\\nachievement test scores may not accurately re ﬂect\\noverall academic functioning nor illuminate speci ﬁc\\nstrengths and weaknesses of the child. Numerousfactors affect how well a child performs on stan-dardized tests, including fatigue, illness, and stress.Because these tests essentially measure perfor-mance on the day of testing, the teacher ratings,\\nwhich re ﬂect performance over time, may be a\\nmore reliable measure on which to base interven-tions. The disadvantage to using school-adminis-tered standardized tests is the infrequency ofmeasurement. In our study, almost a third of thechildren did not have total battery scores, limitingthe strength of data analysis, particularly whenseizure severity was used. The failure to include\\nepilepsy syndromes in analyses is also a limitation of\\nthe study. Huberty and colleagues\\n22have suggested\\nthat the relationship between epilepsy and achieve-ment might be better understood if examined usingsyndromes in addition to seizure severity. Lastly, thecross-sectional data precluded causal inferences.Longitudinal and multietiological studies areneeded to examine causation.Factors associated with academic achievement in children with recent-onset seizures 337Implications for health care professionals working\\nwith children who have seizures include regularassessment of the child ’s academic functioning\\nand school performance. Academic underachieve-ment is often not identi ﬁed or discussed and is often\\noverridden by more pressing medical problems asso-ciated with the disorder; however , it may be asigni ﬁcant problem for the child and family. Findings\\nfrom this study justify using psychosocial and edu-\\ncational assessments for identifying children withepilepsy who may be at risk for academic achieve-ment problems. Because of the strong ﬁndings\\nrelated to child adaptive competency, further inves-tigation is needed to identify interventions toimprove work effort, behavior , overall happiness,and how well the child is learning.\\nTeacher involvement in ongoing assessment and\\nintervention to promote child achievement is essen-tial for success. The development of a multidisci-plinary collaborative program is necessary to deliverappropriate services for children with seizures.Open communication and collaboration betweenmedical and school professionals is required to meetthe special needs of children with epilepsy, with\\nemphasis on training school teachers and adminis-\\ntrators to assess the impact that seizures and med-ications have on classroom performance andinterventions to undertake when problems arise.Coordination between medicine and educationwill enhance the learning environment and leadto interventions that maximize the child ’s ability\\nto succeed.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis research was supported by grant PHS R01NS22416 from the National Institute of NeurologicalDisorders and Stroke to Joan K.

Methods  A series of meta-analyses were conducted to review 46 studies, \\nincluding 2,434 children with epilepsy. Results Effect sizes were medium to large for \\ncomparisons with children from the general population, which indicates that children with \\nepilepsy are at increased risk for psychopathology, including internalizing and externalizing \\nbehavior problems. Comparisons with children wi th another chronic illness revealed small to \\nmedium effect sizes, indicating that psychopathology in children with epilepsy may partly be \\nattributed to chronicity of the disease. Attention problems, thought problems, and social \\nproblems proved to be relatively specific to epilepsy. Comparisons with siblings suggested that psychopathology in children with epilepsy may be  associated with family  factors, especially \\nwhere behavioral disorders ap pear to be more generic. Conclusions  Clinicians should \\nconsider both neurological and ps ychosocial factors, including the family system, when treating \\npsychopathology in children with epilepsy.\\nKey words behavior problems; childhood epilepsy;  family factors; meta-analysis; \\npsychopathology.\\nEpilepsy is a chronic disord er, characterized by recur-\\nrent seizures (Aldenkamp & Mulder, 1998). It is consid-\\nered to be a heterogeneous condition, resulting fromvarious causes and consisting of different syndromesand different seizure types. The unpredictability and dis-\\ntressing nature of the seizures  and social stigma associated\\nwith epilepsy are assumed to influence psychosocialdevelopment (Aldenkamp & Mulder, 1998; Austin,\\nShafer, & Deering, 2002; M acLeod & Austin , 2003) and\\nto have a negative impact on quality of life, causing psy-chopathology (Austin et al., 2002; Ronen, Streiner, &\\nRosenbaum, 2003). Even adults who had seizures during\\na limited period in childhood may still experience adverselong-term effects (Sillanpää, Jalava, Kaleva, & Shinnar,\\n1998).\\nThere is indeed empiri cal evidence showing that\\nchildren with epilepsy exhibit more psychopathologythan children from the general population. For example,\\nthe epidemiological Isle of Wight studies that evaluated\\na broad range of educational,  psychiatric, and physical\\ndisorders in school children in relation to behavioraland educational outcomes re vealed that 28.6% of the\\nchildren with uncomplicated epilepsy had psychiatric\\ndisturbances compar ed with 6.6% of the children from\\nthe general population (Rutter, Tizard, & Whitmore,\\n1970; Rutter, Tizard, Yu le, Graham, & Whitmore,\\n1976). Factors common to ch ronic illnesses — that is,\\ngeneric factors such as me dication regimen, frequent\\nhospitalization, disruption of family life, and limitation\\nof activities (Hamlett, Pellegrini, & Katz, 1992; Kazak,Segal-Andrews, & Johnson, 1995) — rather than epilepsy\\nitself may impede normal developmental processes in\\nchildren with epilepsy. Other generic features of chronic\\nillness, such as invisibility and unstableness could have\\nAll correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to H.R.

Ther efore, the researchers of the present\\nstudy suggest that psychopathology in children with epi-\\nlepsy should not be attributed solely to the chronicity of\\nthe disease, but that specific epilepsy-related factors,including the underlying brain dysfunction, could also\\nplay a role. This is in line with the general finding that\\nchildren with neurological diso rders are at higher risk for\\npsychopathology than childr en with nonneurological\\ndiseases (Breslau, & Marshall, 1985; Lavigne & Faier-\\nRoutman, 1992; Rutter, Graham, & Yule, 1970).\\nThe development or maintenance of psychopathology\\nin children with epilepsy may also be influenced by\\nfamily factors, such as increased parenting stress (Austin,\\nDunn, Johnson, & Perkins, 2004). Sibling research has\\nshown that children with ep ilepsy exhibit more psycho-\\npathology than their siblings , although siblings them-\\nselves are also at increased  risk for the development of\\npsychopathology compar ed to children from the general\\npopulation (Austin et al., 2002; Austin et al., 2001; Hoare,1984b). This may be due to unequal attention to the\\nchild’s needs, differential treatment of siblings or parent-\\ning stress (Mims, 1997; Williams, Williams et al., 2002).Hoare (1984b) suggested that ch ronicity of epilepsy might\\nexert negative effects on fami ly functioning, as he found\\nthat siblings of children wi th chronic epilepsy were at\\nhigher risk for psychopathology than siblings of childrenwith newly onset epilepsy.\\nThe burden of epilepsy as a chronic disease may\\nthus generate negative effects on the family, for exam-ple, by increasing parenting stress, which may affect\\nparent–child interactive be havior (Kazak et al., 1995).\\nRecent research shows that poor parent–child relation-ship quality contributes to child behavior problems in\\nfamilies with a child with epilepsy. For instance, paren-\\ntal criticism has been shown to be related to behavioraldisturbances and antisocial behavior in children with\\nepilepsy (Hodes, Garralda, Rose, & Schwartz, 1999),\\nwhereas Sbarra, Rimm-Kau fman, and Pianta (2002)\\nshowed that parental acceptance was associated with\\nlower levels of externalizin g behavior problems. Other\\nstudies found that psychologi cal control, another dimen-\\nsion of parenting, significantly contributed to internalizing\\nand externalizing behavior problems (Carlton-Ford,\\nMiller, Nealeigh, & Sanchez, 1997; Sbarra et al., 2002).\\nHaber, Austin, Huster, Lane , and Perkins (2003) foundthat family functioning was associated with depression in\\nchildren with epilepsy, while Pianta and Lothman (1994),\\nas well as Austin, Risinger, and Beckett (1992) found that\\nfamily stress contributed to child behavior problems.\\nThus, several studies provide evidence for increased\\nlevels of psychopathology in children with epilepsy\\nwhen compared with children  from the general popula-\\ntion, children with a chronic illness and sibling controls.\\nAlthough narrative reviews have confirmed the high\\nprevalence of psychopathology in children with epilepsy\\n(Besag, 2002; Dunn, 2003; Kim, 1991; Leonard &\\nGeorge, 1999) and have reported specific psychopathol-\\nogy as being present in chil dren with epilepsy, such as\\ndepression (Plioplys, 2003), it is difficult to ascertain\\nwhich particular problems are most common and how\\nsevere these problems are am ong children with epilepsy.\\nFurthermore, although results from empirical studies\\nindicate that children  with epilepsy are at higher risk for\\npsychopathology in comparison with control groups,including children with an other chronic illness, or\\nsiblings, it remains unclear in which specific domains\\nthese differences are largest.\\nAlthough global conclusions about psychopathology\\nin children with epilepsy are available, these conclusions\\ntend to be constrained by in consistent research findings\\nat the level of specific symp tomatology. Meta-analysis is\\na method for combining the numerical results of studies\\nwith different research meth ods and findings. It enables\\nresearchers to discover the consistencies in a set of\\nseemingly inconsistent findings, and to draw conclusions\\nthat are more accurate than th ose presented in any of the\\nseparate studies (Durlak & Lipsey, 1991). As small effectscan be taken into account, due to increased statistical\\npower, and because subjective bias in the interpretation\\nof results is systematically reduced, a more reliablequantitative estimation of behavior problems in children\\nwith epilepsy can be achieved.\\nTo date, no meta-analyses of psychopathology in\\nchildren with epilepsy have  been undertaken. Using\\nmeta-analysis it becomes poss ible to examine the follow-\\ning questions. Which types of psychopathology pre-dominate in children with epilepsy? Which types of\\npsychopathology predomin ate when children with\\nepilepsy are compared to ch ildren with another chronic\\nillness? Which types of psychopathology predominate\\nwhen children with epilepsy  are compared  to siblings?\\nThis study consists of several meta-analyses, comparingchildren with epilepsy to four different control groups\\n(normative groups, healthy study controls, children with\\na chronic illness, and siblings) from a multi-informantperspective (parent report, te acher report, and self-report).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\nPsychopathology in Children with Epilepsy \\uf734\\uf735\\uf735\\nThe goal of the current meta-analytic study is\\nthreefold:\\n1. To examine the types and severity of psychopa-\\nthology in children with epilepsy, by comparing \\nchildren with epilepsy to children from the \\ngeneral population, that is, normative groups and healthy st udy controls.\\n2. To examine differences  in specific symptomatol-\\nogy between children with  epilepsy and children \\nwith another chronic illness, by comparing chil-\\ndren with epilepsy to children with other chronic \\ndiseases, such as asthma and diabetes. If effect \\nsizes (i.e., the magnitud e of differences between \\ngroups) for comparisons with children with a \\nchronic illness are cons iderably smaller than \\neffect sizes for comparis ons with normative and \\nhealthy controls, this co uld indicate that psycho-\\npathology in children with epilepsy is at least partly inherent to epilep sy as a chronic disease.\\n3. To examine differences in specific symptoma-\\ntology between children with epilepsy and their siblings. If effect sizes for differences with sib-\\nlings are small compared to effect sizes for dif-\\nferences with normative and healthy controls, this could indicate that siblings are also at \\nincreased risk for psychopathology (Austin \\net al., 2001; Austin et al., 2002; Hoare, 1984b), and that family factors may be associated with \\npsychopathology in children with epilepsy \\n(Hoare, 1984b).\\nMethod\\nSelection of Studies\\nA literature search was carri ed out, inspecting the child-\\nhood epilepsy literature that was published between\\n1970 (since The Isle of Wight study) and 2003. First, theresearchers searched for studies with computerized\\ndatabases including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, ERIC, and\\nthe Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). The databaseswere explored with a wide range of keywords given in\\ndifferent combinations: behavior, behavior problems,\\ninternalizing problems, externalizing problems, psycho-pathology, adjustment, epil epsy, children, adolescents,\\nbehav*, epilep*, child*, and problem*. (An asterisk\\nindicates that the search wa s not limited to the particu-\\nlar word or fragment.)\\nSecond, the ancestry method  was used to find more\\nstudies on psychopathology in reviews and articlesreporting on empirical studies,  that is, reference sectionsof articles were inspected fo r relevant studies that had\\nnot yet been detected. When  there was doubt about the\\nrelevance of these articles, th ey were visually inspected.\\nThe criteria for inclusion in  the meta-analyses studies\\nwere \\n1. Studies had to include children with epilepsy \\nbetween 4 and 21 years of age without severe \\nmental retardation. Empi rical research on epi-\\nlepsy in children with mental retardation from an epidemiological point of view is sparse (Caplan & \\nAustin, 2000; Steffenburg, Gillberg, & Steffenburg, \\n1996), proba bly because it is too difficult to find \\nadequate comparison groups. Inclusion of chil-\\ndren with mental retardation in the study \\nwould hamper the interpretations of results, as it is not possible to separate the effects of men-\\ntal retardation from the effects of epilepsy if no \\nadequate comparison groups or normative data are available.\\n2. Studies had to measure broadband behavior prob-\\nlems (e.g., internalizing and externalizing prob-lems), narrowband behavior problems (e.g., \\ndepression or aggressive  behavior), or both \\n(Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983).\\n3. Effect sizes were calculated based on ratings of \\nthe primary caregivers, teachers, or children \\nthemselves.\\n4. Studies had to include information enabling the \\ncalculation of effect sizes through comparison with \\na normative control group, healthy study controls, children with a chronic illness, or siblings.\\n5. Samples had to be statistically independent. \\nWhen studies were identifi ed as being statistically \\ndependent, the oldest, original study was included in the analysis.\\nAuthors were contacted if their data did not provide\\nenough statistical  information for the calculation of\\neffect sizes, or if there we re doubts about dependent\\nsamples from multiple studies that were conducted bythe same research groups.\\nThe literature search result ed in 46 studies (Table I)\\nthat met the inclusion criteria. Initially, 62 studies wereidentified that addressed psychopathology in children\\nwith epilepsy. However, 16  studies were excluded as\\nsamples were statistically de pendent, or because it was\\nnot possible to derive statisti cal data relevant for the cal-\\nculation of effect sizes (the  authors could not be reached\\nor they did not have access to their original data sets).Effect sizes were calculated for parent report, teacherDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\n\\uf734\\uf735\\uf736 Rodenburg, Stams, Meijer, Aldenkamp, and Dekovi c\\nTable I.

Children with epilepsy were com-\\npared with:\\n1. normative controls, wh ich means that the calcu-\\nlation of effect sizes wa s based on available pub-\\nlished normative data [for  instance, norms of the \\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL)],\\n2. healthy study controls, who are children included \\nin the studies resembling children from the gen-\\neral population,\\n3. children with a chronic illness (asthma, diabetes, \\ncardiac disease, and migraine), and\\n4. siblings.\\nNone of the studies relying on self-report examined\\ncomparisons with healthy st udy controls, children with\\na chronic illness, or sibling co ntrols (except for self-report\\nof depression). When multiple effect sizes were calculated\\nfor subsamples within the same study (e.g., different agegroups or boys and girls) av erage effect sizes were com-\\nputed and subsequently reported.\\nMeasurements of Psychopathology\\nMost studies reported findings obtained with the CBCL,\\nthe Teacher Report Form (TRF ), or the Youth Self-Report\\n(YSR) (Achenbach, 1991a, 19 91b, 1991c; Achenbach &\\nEdelbrock, 1983). These instr uments assess total behavior\\nproblems, internalizing problems and externalizingproblems (broadband scale s). The CBCL, TRF, and YSR\\nalso contain eight narrowband scales: anxiety/depression,\\nwithdrawal, somatic complaints, aggression, delinquentbehavior, attention problems, thought problems, andsocial problems. Some studies reported on psychopa-\\nthology using the Parental and Teacher Rutter Behavioral\\nScales (Rutter et al., 1970), the Piers-Harris Self-ConceptScale (Piers, 1984), the Child Depression Inventory  (CDI)\\n(Kovacs, 1981), the Birles on Depression Scale (BS)\\n(Birleson, 1981), the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxi-ety Scale (RCMAS) (Reynold s & Richmond, 1985), the\\nConners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) (Conners, 1969),\\nthe Behavior Profile Inventory (BPI) (Adams & Hardy,1988), and the Teacher’s Ra ting of Inattentiveness at\\nSchool (TRIS) (Stores, Hart, & Piran, 1978).\\nCalculation and Analys is of Effect Sizes\\nThe calculation of effect si zes for comparis ons with nor-\\nmative controls was based on the means and standarddeviations (continuous data) provided by the individual\\nstudies. These means and standard deviations were\\nmostly reported as t-scores, that is, standardized scores\\non the CBCL, TRF, and YSR, which are transformationsof continuous data to sc ores corrected for age and\\ngender (Verhulst, van der Ende, & Koot, 1996, 1997).\\nThe reported t-scores (CBCL, TRF, and YSR) were com-\\npared to the normative T-score of 50 ( SD = 10) using\\none-sample t tests. If only percentages of children scor-\\ning above the clinical cutoff were reported, z values were\\ncalculated (categori cal results). The percentages of chil-\\ndren scoring above th e clinical cutoff criterion were then\\ncompared with percentages found in the normative popu-\\nlation: 10% for the broadband scales and 2% for the nar-\\nrowband scales (Verhulst et al., 1996, 1997). The\\ncalculated z values and t values were transformed into\\nthe effect size statistic Cohen’s d. Combined mean effect\\nsizes were calculated for continuous and categorical\\nresults together.\\nThe calculation of effect  sizes for studies using\\ncontrol  groups — healthy study co ntrols, children with a\\nchronic illness, and siblings — was based on reported\\ntest statistics ( p, t, or \\nχ2 values), which were transformed\\ninto Cohen’s d, or on the basis of  reported means and\\nstandard deviations of behavior problems. If studies\\nreported t-scores (CBCL, TRF, and YSR), the t-scores ofboth groups (children with  epilepsy and the control\\ngroup) were used for the calculation of t values by\\nmeans of the two-sample t test. In case of reported\\nmeans and standard deviations, t values were also calcu-\\nlated with the two-sample t test. The calculated t values\\nwere subsequently transformed into Cohen’s d. Effect\\nsizes were only calculated for reports of pretest data;\\nposttest data were not taken into account. For studies\\nreporting nonsignificant fi ndings, effect sizes of d = 0.00\\nwere inserted, based on a one-tailed p of .50 ( z = 0.00).\\nAlthough this is a conservative proced ure, leading to an\\nunderestimation of effect si zes, excluding nonsignificant\\nresults from the meta-analyses leads to an overesti-mation of effect si zes (Rosenthal, 1995).\\nThe computation of eff ect sizes for normative\\ncontrol children resulted in  32 combined mean effect\\nsizes based on 276 calculated effect sizes across all stud-\\nies (broadband behavior problems and narrowband\\nbehavior problems for parent  report, teacher report, and\\nself-report). The calculation of effect sizes for healthy\\nstudy controls resulted in  14 combined mean effect\\nsizes, based on 36 calculated effect sizes across all studies(parent report only). For comparisons with children with\\na chronic illness, 23 combined mean effect sizes were\\ncalculated, based on 68 calculated effect sizes across all\\nstudies. Sibling comparisons resulted in 15 combined\\nmean effect sizes that were  based on 36 calculated effect\\nsizes across all studies. Co mbined mean effect sizes\\nwere computed with Mullen’s (1989) Advanced BASICDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\n\\uf734\\uf735\\uf738 Rodenburg, Stams, Meijer, Aldenkamp, and Dekovi c\\nMeta-Analysis computer program. Additionally, 95%\\nconfidence intervals were computed for each combined\\nmean effect size. Accordin g to generally accepted con-\\nventions, effect sizes of d = 0.20, d = 0.50, and d = 0.80\\nwere considered as indices of small, medium, and large\\ngroup differences (Cohen, 1988 ), whereas effect sizes of\\nd = 0.00 indicated that th ere was no difference between\\nthe groups. A positive eff ect size would indicate that\\nchildren with epilepsy ex perience more psychopathol-\\nogy, whereas a negative ef fect size would indicate that\\ncontrols have higher levels of psychopathology.\\nIn the statistical analys es, Durlak and Lipsey’s\\n(1991) recommendation of sample size weighting wasfollowed; resulting in weighted standardized mean effect\\nsizes. By sample size weighting, studies with large\\nsample sizes exert a greater  influence on the combined\\nmean effect size, which is appropriate because studies\\nwith large sample sizes are assumed to be statistically\\nmore reliable than studies with small sample sizes. This\\nis an adequate procedure in case effect sizes are homoge-\\nneous, that is, when effect  sizes only differ because of\\nsampling error. One of the disadvantages of sample sizeweighting is that when samp le sizes are characterized by\\ngreat disparity, studies with  extreme large sample sizes\\nwill predominate in the we ighted analysis (Lipsey &\\nWilson, 2001, p. 314). Studies with large sample sizes\\noften rely on epidemiologi cal survey methods and may,\\nas a result, have less rigoro us medical inclusion criteria.\\nIn the meta-analyses, one epidemiological study had an\\nextremely large sample of healthy control children\\n(N= 3,950) (McDermott, Mani, & Krishnaswami, 1995).\\nTo correct for this dispropo rtionate large sample size,\\nanalyses for this particular study were based on the\\nwindsorized number ( N = 285), that is, the next highest\\nsample size in the meta-analysis (Hampel, Ronchetti,Rousseeuw, & Stahel, 1986).\\nOutlying effect sizes were identified on the basis of\\nzvalues larger than 3.3 or smaller than –3.3 (Tabachnick,\\n& Fidell, 2001). Homogeneity analyses were conducted at\\np < .05 to examine whether samples of studies were homo-\\ngeneous, that is, to what exte nt effect sizes were constant\\nacross studies. In case of heterogeneity there are differ-\\nences among effect sizes that have some source other than\\nsubject-level sampling error.  These differences may be\\nassociated with different st udy characteristics (Lipsey &\\nWilson, 2001, pp. 115–119).\\nDisjoint cluster analysis wa s used to explain hetero-\\ngeneity of combined mean eff ect sizes. By way of disjoint\\ncluster analysis, it is possible to examine similarities\\nwithin clusters, and differences between clusters ofeffect sizes by identifying cl usters that are significantlydifferent from each other (Mullen, 1989). The next step is\\nthen to understand the source of these differences and\\ncommonalities. For example, if  a cluster with relatively\\nlarge effect size is identified, this may be attributed toparticular seizure types.\\nFile Drawer Analysis\\nA common problem in meta-analysis is that unpublished\\nstudies often lie unu sed in file drawers because of non-\\nsignificant findings, whereas  published studies are more\\nlikely to have achieved statistical significance (Rosenthal,\\n1995). Thus, the studies incl uded in any meta-analysis\\ndo not form a random sample of all studies carried outon the subject. To inspect whether such possible publi-\\ncation bias exists, one can cal culate the fail-safe number\\nthat indicates the minimum number of additional stud-\\nies with nonsignificant results that is needed to decrease\\nsignificant meta-analytic results to nonsignificance\\n(Durlak & Lipsey, 1991). Meta-analytic findings areconsidered to be robust if  the fail-safe number exceeds\\nthe critical value obtained with Rosenthal’s (1995) for-\\nmula of 5 × k + 10; k is the number of studies included\\nin the meta-analysis.\\nResults\\nThe 46 studies included in  the meta-analyses reported\\ndata on 2,434 children with epilepsy, ranging from 13from Korneluk, Kuehn, Keen e, and Ventureyra (2003)\\nto 224 from Austin et al. (2001), 1,180 healthy children,\\n762 children with a chronic illness, and 356 sibling con-trols. The average sample si ze for children with epilepsy\\nwas 65. The mean age of th e children included in the\\nmeta-analyses was 10 years of age, ranging from 4 to 21\\nyears of age. In 22 out of 46 studies, boys were overrepresented (50% or more). A detailed list of studies is\\nprovided in Table I.\\nPreliminary Analyses\\nThe researchers conducted homogeneity analyses ( p < .05)\\nof combined mean effect si zes for parent report, teacher\\nreport, and self-report. Almost all samples of studies com-\\nparing children with epilepsy with study controls (healthy\\ncontrols, children with a ch ronic illness, and siblings)\\nproved to be homogeneous. Homogeneity analysis of\\ncombined mean effect sizes for comparisons with\\nnormative controls revealed  heterogeneity for parent\\nreport, but not for teacher repo rt and self-report. In case\\nof parent report, disjoint cluster analyses ( p < .05) for\\nnormative comparisons showed  that studies containing\\nhigh percentages of children  with intractable epilepsyDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\nPsychopathology in Children with Epilepsy \\uf734\\uf735\\uf739\\nhad relatively large effect sizes for attention problems\\nand thought problems (McCusker, Kennedy, Anderson,\\nHicks, & Hanrahan, 2002; Sabaz, Cairns, Lawson,\\nBleasel, & Bye, 2001). For example, the combined mean\\neffect size was large for children with intractable epilepsy\\nin the study that was carried out by McCusker et al.\\n(d= 9.64). The researchers also found relatively large\\neffect sizes for social probl ems, withdrawn behavior, and\\nsomatic complaints in the study by McCusker et al.\\nDeletion of that study from the meta-analyses resulted inslightly smaller combined mean effect sizes (e.g., atten-\\ntion problems decreased from d = 2.49 to d = 2.31), but\\ndid not result in homogeneity. As heterogeneity remainedafter deletion of those studies that had been identified\\nwith disjoint cluster analysis, and because the magnitude\\nof combined mean effect sizes was only slightly affectedby removal of these studies, the researchers chose to\\nreport on the full set of studies.\\nFor normative comparisons of broadband and\\nnarrowband behavior problems (parent report and teacher\\nreport), externalizing problems and somatic complaints\\n(parent report), and total problems and attention prob-lems (teacher report), the calculated fail-safe numbers\\nexceeded Rosenthal’s (1995) critical value ( k × 5 + 10),\\nwhich indicated that the numb er of studies with nonsig-\\nnificant results (tucked away in file drawers) that would\\nbe required to reduce significant results to nonsignifi-\\ncance was sufficient, indicating no publication bias. Mostfail-safe numbers were extrem ely large. For instance, in\\ncase of normative controls, pa rent report of internalizing\\nproblems revealed a fail-safe number of 2,458 ( k = 17),\\nwhich exceeds Rosenthal’s critical value of 17 × 5 + 10 = 95.\\nThe researchers did, howe ver, encounter possible\\npublication bias for self-rep ort, with the exception of\\ndepression. Fail-safe numbers calculated for study controlgroups (parent report) indicated possible publication\\nbias for the whole range of problems, except for total\\nbehavior problems and attention problems. For exam-\\nple, in case of healthy control children, parent report ofinternalizing problems reveal ed a fail-safe number of\\n3.39 ( k = 3). The critical value was 3 × 5 + 10 = 25,\\nwhich indicates that the fa il-safe number falls below\\nthe critical value. In case of teacher report and self-\\nreport, fail-safe numbers indicated possible publication\\nbias for all scales, and with respect to all study controlgroups.\\nThe Type and Severity of Psychopathology: \\nComparisons with Normative Controls\\nData were available for parent report, teacher report, and\\nself-report (Table II). Effect  sizes were not calculated for\\ntotal behavior problems on the basis of self-report, as data\\ncould not be obtained. Effect sizes for differences between\\nchildren with epilepsy and normative controls were con-sistently large for the whol e range of psychopathology.\\nMeta-analyses of total behavi or problems revealed large\\neffect sizes for both parent report and teacher report: d =\\n1.39 ( p < .001) and d = 0.75 ( p < .001). \\nThe researchers found la rger effect sizes for\\ncomparisons between children with epilepsy and nor-mative controls on internalizing problems than on\\nexternalizing problems.

Differences\\nin the magnitude of effect si zes may point to the influence\\nof family factors. The substa ntial decrease in effect sizes\\nwas less evident for comparis ons involving healthy study\\ncontrols (parent report only). The largest decrease in effect\\nsizes was found for externalizing problems (aggressive anddelinquent behavior), withdrawal, and depression. Meta-\\nanalyses of comparisons with siblings (parent report only)\\nrevealed that withdrawal ( d = 0.04, ns), depression ( d =\\n−.06, ns), delinquency ( d = -.06, ns), and aggression\\n(d= −.01, ns) had extremely small effect sizes, which may\\nindicate relatively strong in volvement of family factors.\\nOnly few syndromes revealed small to medium and signifi-\\ncant effect sizes: attention problems ( d = 0.49, p < .001),\\nthought problems ( d = 0.38, p < .001), social problems ( d =\\n0.34, p< .01), and somatic complaints ( d = 0.46, p < .001).\\nThese larger effect sizes ma y indicate that attention prob-\\nlems, thought problems, social problems, and somaticcomplaints are less strongly a ssociated with family factors.\\nDiscussion\\nThe aim of this study was to conduct meta-analyses of\\nstudies that reported on psychopathology in childrenwith epilepsy in comparison with children from thegeneral population (normative groups and healthy study\\ncontrols), children with a ch ronic illness, and siblings to\\nachieve quantitative evidence for the different types and\\nseverity of psychopathology in children with epilepsy. Inaddition, the researchers an alyzed whether psychopath-\\nology should be considered generic, that is, common to\\nchronic diseases, or specific to epilepsy. Moreover, the\\nresearchers examined whet her family factors (for\\ninstance, family stress or inadequate child rearing prac-\\ntices) could be associated  with psychopathology.\\nThe first goal of the stud y was to examine the sever-\\nity of psychopathology in children with epilepsy. Meta-\\nanalyses of studies compar ing children with epilepsy\\nwith children from the general population revealed\\nmedium to large effect sizes for parent report, teacher\\nreport, and self-report, which confirms that childrenwith epilepsy are at high risk for developing psychopath-\\nology. This conclusion holds for the whole range of\\npsychopathology, including attention problems, thought\\nproblems, and social problems,  as well as internalizing\\nand externalizing behavior. When compared with chil-\\ndren from normative groups, e ffect sizes were larger for\\ninternalizing than for externalizing behavior problems.\\nThis was true for parent report, teacher report, and\\nself-report. A similar pattern has been found for chil-dren with other chronic diseases, such as asthma\\n(McQuaid, Kopel, & Nassau, 2001), chronic arthritis\\n(LeBovidge, Lavigne, Donenberg, & Miller, 2003), andfor children with a chronic i llness in general (Lavigne &\\nFaier-Routman, 1992).\\nInternalizing problems have been investigated fre-\\nquently in children with epil epsy, with a special focus\\non depression and anxiety (Alwash, Hussein, & Mat-\\nloub, 2000; Dunn, Austin, & Huster, 1999; O guz, Kurul,\\n& Dirik, 2002; Williams et al., 2003). Although effectsizes for internalizing proble ms were larger than for\\nexternalizing problems, eff ect sizes for externalizing\\nproblems were still large fo r parent report and teacher\\nreport, indicating that externalizing problems are also\\nfrequently present in children  with epilepsy. Self-report\\ndata, however, showed a small to medium effect size ( d =\\n0.35), which could indicate that children with epilepsy\\nare more accurate reporters of internalizing problems\\nthan of externalizing problems (Card, 2001).\\nProblems that had extremel y large effect sizes were\\nattention problems and somatic complaints (parent report\\nand self-report). Especially children with newly diag-nosed epilepsy have been show n to be at increased risk\\nfor inattentiveness and hyperactivity (Williams, Lange\\net al., 2002). Davies, Heyman, and Goodman (2003) foundthat 12% of the children with uncomplicated epilepsyDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\n\\uf734\\uf736\\uf732 Rodenburg, Stams, Meijer, Aldenkamp, and Dekovi c\\nhad attention-deficit/hyperact ivity disorder (AD/HD) acco-\\nrding to the DSM-IV (Diagn ostic and Statistical Manual\\nof Mental Disorders–fourth edition). Dunn, Austin,\\nHarezlak, and Ambrosius (2003) found that 25% of theadolescents with epilepsy an d 37% of the children with\\nepilepsy had scores above th e clinical cutoff on the\\nattention scale of the CBCL . Research on somatic com-\\nplaints appears to be underrep resented in the literature.\\nOne study showed that 10% of the children with epi-\\nlepsy had additional health complaints other than neu-rological impairments (Kurtz, Tookey, & Ross, 1998).\\nEffect sizes for comparison s with healthy study con-\\ntrols were found to be small to medium, whereas effectsizes for comparisons with no rmative controls proved to\\nbe consistently large (paren t report only). A possible\\nexplanation is that healthy study controls form a rather\\nheterogeneous group drawn from the general popula-\\ntion, consisting of children with psychopathology, not\\nseldom clinically referred, and without psychopathol-ogy. In contrast, normative controls constitute homoge-\\nneous groups of children who have not been clinically\\nreferred for psychopatholo gy (Achenbach, 1991a). An\\neven more compelling expl anation for small-to-medium\\neffect sizes for comparison s with “healthy” study con-\\ntrols could be that these eff ect sizes are less reliable, as\\nthey are based on relatively small sample sizes and less\\nadequate recruitment of co ntrol groups (e.g., Bailet &\\nTurk, 2000).\\nTo summarize, children with epilepsy are at\\nincreased risk for the whol e range of psychopathology,\\nwith somatic complaints and attention problems beingthe most salient symptoms. This general finding shouldbe qualified to the extent that children with epilepsy\\nappear to experience more in ternalizing than externaliz-\\ning behavior problems.\\nThe second goal of this  study was to examine in\\nwhich areas of psychopathology children with epilepsy\\ndiffered from children with another chronic illness, indi-cating whether psychopathology in children with epi-\\nlepsy should be considered as more generic to chronic\\nillness or specific to epilepsy. The meta-analyses showedthat effect sizes for differences with children with a chronic\\nillness were considerably smal ler than effect sizes for\\ncomparisons with children from the general population.From this, it can be derived that psychopathology in\\nchildren with epilepsy may partly be interpreted to be\\nassociated with generic fact ors associated with children\\nwith chronic illnesses. Withdrawn behavior, somatic com-\\nplaints, depression, delinquent behavior, and aggressive\\nbehavior may be considered as relatively generic, aseffect sizes for these problems proved to be small and/ornonsignificant. Attention problems, social problems and\\nthought problems were shown to have the largest effect\\nsizes, which indicates that th ese kinds of problems may\\nbe relatively specific to ch ildren with epilepsy in con-\\ntrast to children with other chronic illnesses.\\nThus, psychopathology in children with epilepsy\\nseems partly attribut able to epilepsy having an effect as a\\nchronic condition. Findings th at children wi th recurrent\\nseizures have higher levels of behavior problems than\\nchildren with newly onset seizures support this conclu-sion (Austin et al., 2001; Ni cholas & Pianta, 1994). The\\nanalyses, however, do not reveal which particular\\ngeneric factors may be asso ciated with psychopathology\\nin children with epilepsy. A limitation of the current\\nmeta-analytic study is that children with epilepsy could\\nonly be compared to childr en that were not neurologi-\\ncally impaired, that is, chil dren with asthma and dia-\\nbetes. As such, the research ers have not been able to\\nidentify unique aspects of ep ilepsy relative to other neu-\\nrologically impairing chronic illnesses.\\nThe third goal of this st udy was to compare children\\nwith epilepsy with their siblings. The analyses revealed\\nthat effect sizes were cons iderably smaller for compari-\\nsons with siblings than fo r comparisons with children\\nfrom the general population . This could indicate that\\nfamily factors are associat ed with psychopathology in\\nchildren with epilepsy. Seve ral studies found that sib-\\nlings of children with epilepsy, but also siblings of chil-dren with other chronic illnesse s, were at higher risk for\\npsychopathology (Austin et al., 2001; Hoare, 1984b;\\nSharpe & Rossiter, 2002). It is possible that family fac-\\ntors directly cause psychopathology in children withepilepsy, or contribute to the maintenance of problems\\nonce they have occurred. Childhood chronic illness,\\nsuch as epilepsy, may also cause disturbances in family\\nprocesses that, in turn, cou ld affect the adjustment of\\nsiblings. It should be admitt ed that the analyses provide\\nindirect support for the role of family factors. Given thecorrelational nature of the evidence, it is impossible to\\nderive the exact direction of  effects. Moreover, parents\\nmay be biased towards reporting similar behaviorsacross siblings so as not to emphasize behavioral diffi-\\nculties in any one particular child.\\nExcept for somatic complaints, relatively smaller\\neffect sizes for comparisons with siblings were most\\nprominent in behavior problems that were identified as\\ngeneric to chronic illness, namely, externalizing behav-ior, withdrawal, and depr ession. Therefore, the\\nresearchers suggest that family factors may be related\\nmore strongly to behavior problems that are relativelycommon to chronic diseases. In contrast, the resultsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\nPsychopathology in Children with Epilepsy \\uf734\\uf736\\uf733\\nsuggested that family factor s may play a minor role in\\nthe contribution to behavior problems that are more\\nspecific to epilepsy, namely , attention problems, thought\\nproblems, and social problems.\\nA number of studies examin ed children with previ-\\nously unrecognized seizures and found higher levels of\\npsychopathology (Austin et al., 2001; Dunn, Austin, &\\nHuster, 1997; Dunn, Harezl ak, Ambrosius, Austin, &\\nHale, 2002). It was concluded that neurological dysfunc-\\ntion causes both behavior problems and seizures. Thisdoes not exclude the possibi lity, however, that addi-\\ntional risk factors contribute to behavior problems in\\nchildren with enduring epilepsy. The study findings sug-gest that especially children  with uncontro llable seizures\\nare at risk for the development of behavior problems,\\nsince the researchers found rela tively large effect sizes for\\nstudies that included children with intractable epilepsy.\\nProblems inherent to chronic diseases — such as unpre-\\ndictability, distress, medication regimen, social stigma,and family stress — may arise in children with longer\\nlasting epilepsy apart from neurological dysfunction.\\nThe current series of meta-analyses have been con-\\nducted on the basis of parent  report, teacher report and\\nself-report. In general, effect sizes were slightly smaller\\nfor teacher report and self-rep ort than for parent report.\\nRelatively large effect sizes for parent report in compari-\\nson with teacher report mi ght indicate that children\\nwith epilepsy show more psychopathology at home. As\\nsuch, this could provide ad ditional evidence for the\\ninvolvement of family factors, such as increased family\\nstress. These larger effect sizes could also indicate that\\nparents are relatively sensitive to their children’s behav-ior problems (Huberty, Au stin, Harezlak, Dunn, &\\nAmbrosius, 2000). Smaller eff ect sizes for self-report may\\nindicate that children with epilepsy underestimate their\\nbehavior problems, especially with respect to externalizing\\nbehavior, presenting themselv es as healthy functioning\\nindividuals (Huberty et al., 2000; Sbarra et al., 2002).\\nThree limitations of this study should be men-\\ntioned. A first limitation is that meta-analyses for com-\\nparisons with healthy stud y controls, children with a\\nchronic illness, and siblings were based on a small num-\\nber of studies per analysis. Fail-safe numbers calculated\\nfor comparisons with these control groups often did notexceed Rosenthal’s (1995) crit ical value, indicating the\\nexistence of possible publicat ion bias. Rosenthal (1991),\\nhowever, found a small effect size of only 0.07 for differ-\\nences between meta-analytic reviews using published\\nstudies and meta-analytic reviews using unpublished\\nstudies, such as unpublished dissertations, papers and\\nresearch reports. The res earchers conclude that mostconfidence in research find ings can be obtained from\\ncomparisons with normativ e controls by means of\\nparent report, as these comparisons were based on a\\nrelatively large number of studies, finding no publica-tion bias.\\nA second limitation is that most reports of psycho-\\npathology were assessed with the CBCL, the TRF, or theYSR. Although these question naires are common in the\\nassessment of behavior problems in the realm of pediat-\\nrics, it should be noted that the CBCL, TRF, and YSRwere not developed to measure behavior problems in\\nchildren with chronic illnesse s (Perrin, Stei n, & Drotar,\\n1991). In children with ep ilepsy, items may rather mea-\\nsure seizure features than behavior problems per se\\n(Oostrom, Schouten, Kruitw agen, Peters, & Jennekens-\\nSchinkel, 2001). However, even if parents were askednot to include behaviors that might be related to sei-\\nzures, children with epilepsy  had higher levels of psy-\\nchopathology than children from the general population(Austin et al., 2001).\\nA final limitation is that this study does not report\\non current and past medicat ion usage of the children\\nwith epilepsy included in the meta-analyses. It is well\\nknown that children with ep ilepsy who take antiepilep-\\ntic drugs experience a wide range of side effects that mayhave a negative impact on behavioral adaptation inde-\\npendent of actual disease processes (Besag, 2004;\\nBootsma et al., 2004; Handler & DuPaul, 1999).\\nThis meta-analytic study is unique to the extent that\\nit combines comparisons betw een children with epilepsy\\nand different control groups  into one study from a\\nmulti-informant perspectiv e. The researchers found\\nelevated levels of psychopathology in children with epi-\\nlepsy in comparison with children from the general popu-\\nlation. Although children wi th epilepsy appear to have\\nmore internalizing problems than externalizing prob-\\nlems, the presence of externalizing problems remains\\nconsistently high. Results suggest that psychopathologyis partly attributable to ep ilepsy as a chronic disorder.\\nAttention problems, thought problems, and social prob-\\nlems were found to be relatively specific to epilepsy.Children with intractable epilepsy were found to be\\nhighly at risk for atte ntion and thought problems\\n(McCusker et al., 2002; Sabaz et  al., 2001), but also for\\nsocial problems, withdrawn behavior , and somatic com-\\nplaints (McCusker et al., 2002 ). Finally, the researchers\\nfound interesting, but indir ect evidence for the associa-\\ntion of family factors with psychopathology in children\\nwith epilepsy.\\nFuture research on psychopathology in children with\\nepilepsy should focus on a multifactorial framework,Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article-abstract/30/6/453/948830 by guest on 12 October 2019\\n\\uf734\\uf736\\uf734 Rodenburg, Stams, Meijer, Aldenkamp, and Dekovi c\\nconsidering both neurological  and psychosocial factors\\n(including family processe s) that may contribute to\\npsychopathology (Hermann & Whitman, 1992, 1984;\\nSeidenberg & Berent, 1992). This also includes broaden-ing the research to include si blings of children with epi-\\nlepsy. Clinicians should be aware that children with\\nepilepsy are at increased risk for the development of\\ninternalizing and externalizing behavior problems.\\nMoreover, they should take into account that some\\nproblems may be common to children with a chronicdisease, whereas other problems tend to be relatively\\nspecific to epilepsy. This may have implications for\\ntreatment. As a final point, clinicians should incorporatefamily factors in their diag nosis and treatment of psy-\\nchopathology in child ren with epilepsy.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe researchers thank Godfried van den Wittenboer for\\nstatistical advice and Kasper  Abcouwer who supported\\nus with processing meta-analytic results adequately.\\nReceived February 19, 2004; revisions received May 27,\\n2004, September 24, 2004, and November 30, 2004;\\naccepted December 6, 2004\\nReferences\\nReferences marked with an  asterisk indicate studies \\nincluded in the meta-analysis.\\nAchenbach, T.

Risk factors possibly associated with school performance,such as adolescent variables (age, gender, perceived stigma,attitude toward epilepsy, and psychopathology), seizure vari-ables (age at onset of illness, years of illness, types of seizures,and frequency of seizures per month), drug variables [types ofantiepileptic drugs (AEDs), number of AEDs and side effectsof AEDs], and family variables (family’s socioeconomic status,family functioning, caretakers’ psychopathology, and caretak-ers’ perceived stigma) were assessed.Results: The mean school grades of adolescents with epilepsy\\nare significantly lower than are those of their healthy controls(p<0.001) in all the subjects. The variables that significantly\\npredict poor school performance in adolescents with epilepsy in-clude psychopathology in the caretaker (p <0.001), adolescents’\\nperceived poor family functioning (p =0.002), adolescents’ atti-\\ntude toward the illness (p =0.001), adolescents’ felt stigma (p =\\n0.002), externalizing symptoms in the adolescents (p =0.004),\\nand duration of illness (p =0.024).\\nConclusions: The determinants of poor school performance\\nin adolescents with epilepsy in Nigeria are multivariate,with psychosocial factors most important. These should benoted for early identification and screening of those chil-dren at greatest risk for academic failure and the greatestneed for appropriate educational remediation services. Key\\nWords: Adolescents—Childhood—Epilepsy—Risk factors—\\nAcademic performance—Cross-cultural—Psychopathology.\\nEpilepsy is the most common neurologic disorder in\\nNigeria, affecting 60% of the children seen in pedi-atric neurology clinics (1). Children and adolescents withseizures are at increased risk of emotional, behavioral, andcognitive (2–6) disorders.\\nEarlier studies have documented problems in academic\\nperformance of children and adolescents with epilepsywhen compared with healthy children and adolescents orchildren with other chronic conditions (7–10). More recentstudies (11–13) also found similar results.\\nAlthough the occurrence of educational underachieve-\\nment in children with epilepsy is well documented, thefactors underlying this academic vulnerability have notyet been clearly identified. Seidenberg et al. (9) foundthat academic underachievement was associated with alonger duration of seizures, multiple seizure types, andmore refractory seizures, whereas other studies (10,12)found no association with seizure variables.

Williams et al.(12) found that attention was the only variable associatedwith achievement scores. Austin et al. (11) reported thatmale sex, poor adaptive functioning in school, negativeattitude toward illness, and seizure severity are associatedwith poorer academic performance in children and ado-lescents with epilepsy. Fastenau et al. (13) found that chil-dren with epilepsy with neuropsychological deficits anddisorganized, unsupportive environments are particularlyat risk for adverse academic outcomes.\\nDespite the volume of research, these studies have been\\nlimited by several factors. Many have not distinguished be-tween children and adolescents, whereas adolescents arefaced with the peculiar challenge of adjustment to differ-ent inherent changes than are children. Epilepsy may makesuccessful adjustment even more difficult by disruptingself-control, adversely affecting the ability to conform toone’s peers, and interfering with independence. Other lim-itations include small sample size, the use of parents’ orteachers’ reports of school performance, and use of in-telligence rating scales without actual records of schoolgrades obtained. Moreover, the effect of emotional and\\n415416 A. O. ADEWUYA ET AL.\\nbehavioral problems experienced by many of these ado-\\nlescents on school performance has not been adequatelyresearched.\\nIn Africa, epilepsy is still regarded as highly contagious\\nand incurable in the traditional communities (14). Theadolescents with epilepsy are highly stigmatized and dis-criminated against in schools by fellow students (15) andthe teachers (16). In Nigeria, >36% of children and 6%\\nof adolescents with epilepsy have never attended school(17), whereas about half of adolescents with epilepsy whowere attending school withdrew from school prematurelybecause of their seizures (18).\\nA dearth of study is found on the school performance\\nof adolescents with epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa. Nonehas been done in Nigeria. The development of basic aca-demic competence is of considerable importance for fu-ture educational, social, and occupational adjustment andfunctioning. Identifications of the factors underlying theacademic vulnerability of adolescents with epilepsy areimportant to determine appropriate evaluation and treat-ment programs.\\nThe purpose of the present study is to assess the school\\nperformance in a population of Nigerian adolescents withepilepsy and examine the variables that correlate with aca-demic difficulties in these adolescents.\\nMETHODS\\nSubjects\\nThe subjects for the study consisted of a consecutive se-\\nries of 73 adolescents with epilepsy aged 12 to 18 years andtheir caretakers attending outpatient neuropsychiatric clin-ics of the Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa a unit of ObafemiAwolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAU-THC). OAUTHC is a tertiary health institution that pro-vides specialist service to about three states in westernNigeria. Most neurological referrals from these states areto the OAUTHC. Exclusion criteria from the study includemental retardation, not attending school in Ilesa, and beingnonverbal. All the subjects were diagnosed and receivingmanagement for epilepsy for ≥1 year before the recruit-\\nment. In the month before presentation, 22 (30.1%) ofthem had no seizure, 19 (26.0%) had one seizure, another19 (26.0%) had two seizures, and 13 (17.8%) had threeseizures.\\nSixty-eight (93.2%) of the caretakers were the moth-\\ners. The remaining were fathers or close relatives re-sponsible for the adolescents’ care. The family’s so-cioeconomic status, measured by using the Hollingsheadscale (19), showed that 32 (43.8%) were from a lowsocioeconomic group, 22 (30.2%) were from a middlegroup, and 19 (26.0%) were from a high socioeconomicgroup. This scale had been translated and standardized foruse in studies in Nigeria (5) Adolescents’ psychopathol-ogy, measured by the caretakers completing the Rutter’sParent Questionnaire (RA2) (20), also showed that 46(63.0%) scored above the 13 cutoff point for probable\\npsychopathology in the adolescents.\\nA total of 82 matched adolescents without epilepsy\\nfrom the same classes as the adolescents with epilepsywere recruited as controls. They were initially individu-ally matched for class, age, and sex (first producing 302controls) and then further matched for socioeconomic sta-tus and presence of probable psychopathology by askingtheir caretakers to complete the Hollingshead scale and theRA2. Matching at the individual level for these variablesreduced the control group to 82.\\nTesting Procedure\\nWritten informed consents were obtained from the par-\\nticipants and their caretakers after the aims and objectivesof the study had been explained. The Ethics and ResearchCommittee of the OAUTHC approved the study protocol.\\nAssessments\\nAdolescents’ variables\\nThese include age, sex, level of education/class, adoles-\\ncents’ perception of epilepsy stigma, and adolescents’ at-titude toward epilepsy and adolescents’ psychopathology.Perceived stigma was measured with a three-item scale(21). Each of the three items requires a simple yes/no re-sponse. An individual’s score is the sum of the positiveresponses. The higher the scores, the greater the percep-tion of stigma.\\nThe Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale (CATIS) was\\nused to measure attitude toward epilepsy. The CATIS (22)is a 13-item self-report scale that provides information onhow children and adolescents feel about their health con-ditions. The adolescents respond on 5-point scales, withhigher scores reflecting a more positive attitude. The meanattitude score ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 5.\\nAdolescents’ psychopathology was measured by the\\ncaretakers completing the RA2 (20), which consists of31 items summed into a total score that measures over-all deviance. Each item is scored from 0 to 2 (0, doesnot apply; 1, applies to some extent; 2, certainly applies)with a total score ranging from 0 to 62. A total score of≥13 on the RA2 indicates a probable psychiatric disorder.\\nTwo subscales yield scores indicative of internalizing oremotional-type disorders (five items) and externalising orconduct-type disorder (five items). The maximum scoreon each of the subscales is 10 points.\\nSeizure variables\\nThe age at onset of illness, duration of epilepsy, and\\nseizure type were obtained from the case files. A detailedEEG profile was not possible in an underdeveloped settinglike this, but because the adolescents were diagnosed andmanaged by specialists in neurology and psychiatry, thecase-file diagnoses were quite reliable. Also from the casefiles were the medication variables like types and numbersof antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and side effects of AEDs.\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2006SCHOOL PERFORMANCE OF ADOLESCENTS WITH EPILEPSY 417\\nFamily variables\\nThese include family functioning, the family’s socioe-\\nconomic status, caretakers’ perception of stigma, and psy-chopathology in the caretaker. The family’s socioeco-nomic status was measured by using the Hollingsheadscale (19). This scale has been translated and standard-ized for use in studies in Nigeria (5).\\nFamily functioning was measured by using the family\\nApgar (23). The caretakers and adolescents independentlycompleted the scale. This five-item questionnaire mea-sures each family member’s satisfaction with five aspectsof family functioning (adaptation, partnership, growth, af-fection, and resolve) by using 5-point scales ranging from0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with a higherscore reflecting more satisfaction and better family rela-tionships. A score of 14 to 20 suggests a highly functionalfamily; a score of 8 to 13 suggests a moderately dysfunc-tional family; and a score of 0 to 7 suggests a severelydysfunctional family. Total scores from mothers and ado-lescents were used in data analysis.\\nThe caretakers’ perception about stigma associated with\\nthe adolescents’ epilepsy was measured with a five-itemscale, adapted from an adult scale by Ryan et al. (24).Parents rated their perception of stigma on 7-point scalesof 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely), with a higher scorereflecting more stigmas.\\nThe caretakers also completed the 30-item General\\nHealth Questionnaire (GHQ-30). The GHQ-30 (25) is aself-report rating scale designed to detect psychiatric mor-bidity in general and medical outpatient settings. The scalealso has been widely applied as a screening instrument incommunity-based epidemiologic studies in Nigeria witha cut-off of ≥5 for probable psychiatric morbidity\\nSchool performance\\nThe school attendance and academic records of the ado-\\nlescents with epilepsy over three school terms (1 year)before evaluation were obtained. The mean scores of theadolescents with epilepsy on all subjects were comparedwith the mean scores of healthy adolescents of the sameage and sex in the same class. All the adolescents withepilepsy attend regular public secondary schools withoutseparate classrooms for children with special needs. Allthe public secondary schools in Osun state in Nigeria runthe same curriculum and take a common centrally coordi-nated examination at the end of each school session. Thisreduces the bias of the school teacher in awarding gradesto pupils. Although separate schools exist in Nigeria forchildren with special needs or disabilities, none of oursubjects is attending such a school.\\nStatistical analyses\\nThe statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS\\n11) program was used for the statistical analysis. For theseanalyses, the mean school scores were considered as de-pendent variables. The independent variables included inthe analysis include adolescents’ variables (age, sex, per-\\nceived stigma, attitude toward epilepsy, and psychopathol-ogy), seizure variables (age at onset of illness, years ofillness, type of seizure, and frequency of seizures permonth), drug variables (type of AED, number of AEDs,and side effects of AEDs), and family variables (family’ssocioeconomic status, family functioning, caretakers’ psy-chopathology, and caretakers’ perceived stigma). Resultswere calculated as frequencies (%), means, and standarddeviations. Groups’ comparisons were achieved by paired-sample ttest,χ\\n2test, and the Kruskal–Wallis test. Corre-\\nlation was by Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Signifi-cance was computed at p <0.05. The dependent variable\\nwas examined separately as a function of the remainingvariables by using a stepwise multiple regression analysisto determine the contribution of study parameters to themean school scores.\\nRESULTS\\nDescriptive statistics of the adolescents, seizures, and\\ncaretakers’ variables\\nThe mean age of the adolescents is 14.47 years (SD,\\n2.10). They are predominantly (63.0%) male. The meanduration of illness is 8.67 years (SD, 3.25), with the meanage at onset of epilepsy of 5.80 years (SD, 2.36) .Themean frequency of seizures per month is 2.11 (SD, 1.53).Although many of the adolescents experienced more thanone seizure type at a time, the dominant type of seizureclinically diagnosed in the case files was used for thisstudy. Most of the adolescents and caretakers rated theirfamilies as highly functional, with the correlation betweenthe adolescents and caretakers rating on Apgar having acorrelation of 0.287 (p =0.01). The details of adolescents’\\nvariables, seizure variables, and family variables are out-lined in Table 1.\\nSchool performance of adolescents with epilepsy\\ncompared with that of healthy adolescents\\nThe mean scores in the English language, mathemat-\\nics, and mean overall total scores of the adolescents withepilepsy over the past three terms (1 academic year) werecompared with those of their healthy classmates of thesame age and sex.

The raw scores of adolescents with epilepsywere then converted to index scores on this scale.

We also examined the variables associated withschool performance in adolescents with epilepsy.\\nWe found that the performance of adolescents with\\nepilepsy was significantly lower than that of nonepilepsycontrols in the English language, mathematics, and over-all scores, with performance worst in mathematics. Thisis in agreement with earlier findings in Western cultures(9,10,13).\\nOur study demonstrated that psychosocial and family\\nfactors were the strongest associates of poor school perfor-mance in our group of adolescents with epilepsy. Havingparents with psychopathology might be an environmen-tal stressor to the adolescents and might affect the schoolperformance. We also found that poor family function-ing, rated by the adolescents, predicts poor school per-formance. This is in agreement with other studies (10,13)that reported poor home environment as a predictor ofpoor school performance in children and adolescents withepilepsy. Poor family functioning and stress within thefamily had been shown to be significantly associated withincreased risk of behavioral problems in children and ado-lescents with epilepsy (26,27). This could lead to poorschool performance. It has been suggested that the impactof neuropsychological deficiencies on academic achieve-ment is moderated by the family environment (13). Orga-nization, support, planning, and order at home can help thechild with cognitive limitations to complete homework\\nWe found that a negative attitude toward illness and felt\\nstigma were significantly associated with poor school per-formance in adolescents with epilepsy. Austin et al. (11)earlier reported a significant association between negativeattitude to illness, poor adaptive functioning, and poorschool performance. Adolescents’ attitudes toward theirillness can influence their adjustments to their conditions\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2006SCHOOL PERFORMANCE OF ADOLESCENTS WITH EPILEPSY 419\\nTABLE 3.

Thiscould be due to decrease attention, which had been re-ported in earlier studies (6,12). It is equally plausible thatthe adolescents exhibit externalizing behaviors because ofschool performance (e.g., out of frustration or to get at-tention through means other than academics). It is alsopossible that the low school performance and externaliz-ing behaviors are directly caused by the seizure condition,and therefore covary together as a function of a commoncause. We also found that longer duration of illness wasassociated with poor overall school performance. This isin support of earlier findings (9).\\nUnlike some other studies (9–11) and in agreement with\\nWilliams et al. (12), we did not find any association be-tween age, gender, socioeconomic status, types and fre-quency of seizures, and poor school performance in ado-lescents with epilepsy.\\nThe limitations of our study include the fact that we did\\nnot conduct a complete psychometric evaluation on thechildren with epilepsy and the healthy controls to excludestudents with mild degree of mental retardation. Childrenwith minor degrees of mental retardation do attend regularschools, and unless a complete psychometric evaluationis performed, they can easily escape diagnosis. The ob-served poor academic performance of these children maythen reflect their decreased intellectual levels. Informationabout grade level may not be sufficient to determine aca-demic development. However, the standard achievementtests have not been validated in Nigeria and may have cul-tural bias. Although studies have reported that classroomratings by the teachers can be affected both positively andnegatively by their knowledge of the disorder (28,29), itshould be noted that this may not apply to this study be-cause the classroom teachers were not the ones to awardthe grades in the term examinations. We did not examinethe teachers’ behavior and attitude toward the adolescentswith epilepsy, although teachers’ attitudes and expecta-tions have been implicated as a possible negative sourceof influence on the academic performance of children withepilepsy (7). We also assessed psychopathology in the ado-lescents by using parental ratings of behaviors, which is\\nsubjective. We used only clinician diagnosis of the typeof seizures without EEG support, but EEG diagnosis isexpensive in this part of the continent. Finally, we did notexamine the control group for all the psychosocial andfamily variables found in the index group .\\nIn conclusion, we showed that the school performance\\nof Nigerian adolescents with epilepsy is significantlylower than that of their counterparts of the same class, age,sex, and socioeconomic status. We also showed that poorschool performance in these adolescents was predictedby psychosocial variables including psychopathology inboth the adolescents and their caretakers; adolescents’ feltstigma, attitude toward the illness, and perception of fam-ily functioning.\\nThe implications of our findings are that the determina-\\ntion of epilepsy-related variables that correlate with poorschool performance would be useful for early identifica-tion and screening of those children at greatest risk foracademic failure and the greatest need for appropriate ed-ucational remediation services\\nREFERENCES\\n1.Izuora GI, Iloeje SO.

The prevalence of LD in the generalpopulation has been found to be 2–10% and reading disordersare the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonestneurological disorders in childhood with an estimated preva-lence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic orcryptogenic in approximately two-thirds of cases. LD are morecommon in people with epilepsy than in the general popula-tion: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD.\\nVarious psychosocial, medication-related, and epilepsy-relatedfactors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be ei-ther permanent or state-dependent. Permanent LD are causedby a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast,state-dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; theyare caused by epilepsy-related factors. If allowed to persist fora long period, a state-dependent LD may become permanent.Key Words: Learning—Epilepsy—Epidemiology.\\nDEFINITION OF LEARNING DISORDERS\\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders IV , Text Revised Edition (DSM IV-TR),Learning Disorders (LD) are defined as disorders whichinterfere significantly with academic performance or withdaily activities, which require reading, writing, or mathe-matical skills in subjects with a normal intelligence quo-tient (IQ) (1).\\nLD are also defined by a significant discrepancy\\nbetween a child’s intellect (learning) ability and a spe-cific area of academic achievement, based on individualpsychological testing (2). An important aspect of the def-inition of LD is in its exclusions: LD cannot be attributedprimarily to mental retardation, emotional disturbances,difference, or disadvantage (3). Nevertheless, definitionsand diagnostic criteria for LD are subjective and ambigu-ous (4). In some countries, for example, in the UnitedKingdom, the term learning disability is used to indicate\\nmental retardation and the term specific learning disability\\nis used to indicate that the subject has disproportionatelypoorer performance in one or more cognitive abilities usu-ally, although not necessarily, without global mental retar-dation (5). Children present with low IQ scores because ofepilepsy, medication, or other related problems, althoughthey have normal underlying intelligence. For example, in\\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. M. Beghi, Depart-\\nment of Clinical Psychiatry, University of Milano-Bicocca, Via Cadore48 Monza, Milan, Italy.

Moreover, children with LD of-ten present with behavioral and psychological disorderswhich may be confounding factors when attempting tomeasure true IQ scores.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF LD IN THE GENERAL\\nPOPULATION\\nAccording to the DSM IV-TR, the prevalence of LD in\\nthe general population is 2–10%, depending on the typeof evaluation and definition used. Moreover, 3–5% of stu-dents of U.S. public schools have LD (1). According toLyon, the prevalence of LD seems to have increased inthe recent decades; this may be related to the increasedliteracy rate and the greater attention given to the prob-lem. Most of the available information concerning LDis for reading disabilities, and the majority of childrenwith LD have primary deficits in basic reading disabili-ties (3). Although reading disorders are the most commonsubtypes of LD (7), they are often masked by deficits inphonology, and this may be a confounding factor in deter-mining the real prevalence of this clinical condition; theyare significantly more common in boys than in girls (OR1.4–3.2), but the size of the difference varies across stud-ies carried out in different countries (United Kingdom,New Zealand, United States) (8). The influences that un-derlie sex differences in reading and writing disorders areunknown (3). In contrast, the prevalence of mathematicsdisorders is not significantly different between boys and\\n14LEARNING DISORDERS IN EPILEPSY 15\\ngirls (9), although the results of different studies carried\\nout in Slovakia, United States, Germany, and Switzerlanddiffer (9).\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF EPILEPSY\\nIN THE GENERAL POPULATION\\nEpilepsy is one of the most common serious neurolog-\\nical disorders in childhood (10). Epidemiological stud-ies over the past few decades have greatly increased theknowledge of the incidence and prognosis of seizures. Therisk of epilepsy is highest in patients with an associatedserious neurological abnormality, such as mental retarda-tion and cerebral palsy (symptomatic epilepsy) (10). Theaverage annual rate of new cases per year (incidence) ofepilepsy is approximately 5 –7 cases per 10,000 children\\nfrom birth to age 15 yr (11). Review articles emphasizethe difficulty of comparing studies; variations in incidencerates may not only reflect differences in occurrence butalso differences in case definition, diagnostic accuracy,and study populations. Variations in prevalence may alsodepend on the definition of active epilepsy (12 –14). More-\\nover, prevalence studies in childhood epilepsy have beencarried out in different geographical areas, age groups,and ethnic groups, with differing design and methods (11).Despite these differences, it is possible to rate the preva-lence of epilepsy in children as 4 –5/1,000 (11). According\\nto several population-based studies, this prevalence tendsto increase from 2 –3/1,000 at age 7 to 4 –6/1,000 at age\\n11–15 (12,15 –18). A wide variety of seizure disorders\\nare included under the term epilepsy. Approximately two-thirds of cases were considered idiopathic (12). Childrenwith additional health problems were more likely to con-tinue to have seizures in early adult life than those withepilepsy alone (13,15).\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF ACADEMIC DIFFICULTIES\\nAND LD IN EPILEPSY\\nIt is well known that learning and behavioral disorders\\nare more common in people with epilepsy than in the gen-eral population (19,20), but these disabilities are not nec-essarily related to mental retardation. About 50% of chil-dren with epilepsy have school-related difficulties (21).These difficulties may range from slight underachieve-ment to quite severe problems, and a third of these needsan additional academic support (21), but only less than 1%attend special epilepsy schools (22). Academic weaknessis not confined to one area; underachievement has beenfound in a variety of domains including maths, spelling,writing to dictation, reading comprehension, and generalknowledge (20). Furthermore, 30% of children with drug-resistant epilepsy receive specialized academic education,compared to 9% of controls (children without neurologi-cal problems) and, in at least one study, it has been foundthat only 33% of children with epilepsy aged 12 –18 yr at-tended “secondary school, ”compared to 68% of controls\\n(23,24). In a population-based study, after a 7-yr follow-up, 34% of 337 children with epilepsy and normal IQwere seen to fail in their school achievements and 34%of these had special educational support (25). Up to 25%of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD, and con-versely, up to 50% of all patients with LD are said to haveseizure disorders (26). A population-based study, carriedout in two Finland provinces, documented a correlationbetween epilepsy, disability, and handicap in 143 childrenwith epilepsy aged 4 –15 yr. LD were present in 23%: read-\\ning disorders in 18.6%, writing disorders in 17.6%, andmathematic disorders in 14.7% (19).\\nPREDICTORS OF LD IN EPILEPSY\\nMultiple factors have been associated with learning\\ndeficits in epilepsy, such as various psychosocial, med-ication, and epilepsy-related factors (6). Older childrenhave a higher prevalence of LD than younger children(27). An earlier onset of seizures ( <2 yr) is linked with\\ncognitive impairment (28,29). Possible reasons for this in-clude: because the insult on the brain caused by seizuresinterferes with the development of learning functions, be-cause early onset may increase the vulnerability of thebrain to the deleterious effect of seizures, and becauselate-onset seizures are more likely to stop spontaneously(28). Also, a higher number of seizures or multiple seizuretypes in a patient may be a predictor of LD (27). However,the role of a brain lesion or dysfunction in causing LDis not clear; some authors found worse academic perfor-mances in symptomatic epilepsies than in cryptogenic oridiopathic epilepsies (28); in contrast, other authors didnot find a significant difference between the groups, pos-sibly because in the cryptogenic epilepsy an underlyingbrain abnormality has not been found but is neverthelesspresent (29). There is concordance in the literature on therole of the dominant hemisphere in LD, especially in read-ing comprehension and in calculation disabilities (6). Pa-tients with temporal lobe epilepsy have worse academicperformance, especially in verbal functions, when the lefthemisphere is involved (6,29). When the right hemisphereis involved, there is an impairment in visual tests. How-ever, for visual tests a patient also needs verbal abilities,and there is not a significant lateralization for these tests(29). In addition, the presence of an associated mood orpsychotic disorder and genetic susceptibility to LD are im-portant predictors. Although some studies of cognitive andbehavioral changes in patients with epilepsy may suggestan effect of antiepileptic drugs, an unequivocal cause –\\neffect relationship is yet to be established. Only patientstreated with phenobarbital or primidone have been shownto have lower scores as compared to controls. There isno significant difference between the other drugs, proba-bly because the positive effect of drugs on seizure control\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 47, Suppl. 2, 200616 M. BEGHI ET AL.\\ncontrasts with the adverse effects on cognitive functions\\n(30).\\nPERMANENT AND STATE-DEPENDENT LD\\nCognitive impairment could be considered the link be-\\ntween epilepsy and LD in epilepsy. According to Besag(22), LD may be permanent or state-dependent. The preva-lence of each type is not known (5). Permanent LD arecaused by brain lesions and/or stable brain dysfunction.The cause of brain damage and/or dysfunction may be pre-natal, perinatal, or postnatal. Many chromosomal abnor-malities or specific epilepsy syndromes (encephalopathy)are linked to the presence of both epilepsy and permanentLD. In this case, they are both distinct consequences ofthe same brain lesion or dysfunction. On the other hand,epilepsy (e.g., status epilepticus) may cause brain lesionsor dysfunctions which cause permanent LD. In fact, singlecomplex partial and secondarily generalized seizures areassociated with neural damage (31), and brain extracellu-lar glutamate may build up to neurotoxic levels in partialseizures (32).\\nOn the other hand, state-dependent LD are potentially\\nreversible and treatable. They are caused by current factorsaffecting patients with epileptic seizures, like epileptic ac-tivity which may directly cause LD without a brain lesionand/or dysfunction and/or antiepileptic treatment, whichare both not necessarily permanent (22). Epilepsy itselfmay cause state-dependent LD in the following ways:\\n•Ictal changes (e.g., frequent absence seizures, non-\\nconvulsive status epilepticus, sleep disturbances).Children with frequent atypical absence or with non-convulsive status epilepticus (with generalized orcomplex partial seizures) may have significant dif-ficulties in school performances due to interruptionsof awareness in the classroom. Moreover, silent noc-turnal seizures may affect school performances theday after.\\n•Periictal changes. They may be prodromes during\\nwhich some people experience changes in mood forhours or days before a seizure and these experiencesare likely to affect both learning and behavior. Pos-tictal changes like sleepiness, postictal depressive,maniac, or schizophreniform paranoid changes maydisrupt schooling.\\n•The presence of frequent subtle seizures and the di-\\nrect effects of interictal EEG epileptiform discharges(transitory cognitive impairment). Absence seizuresor interictal epileptiform discharges can interruptawareness and, if they occur frequently, learning andsocialization may be very difficult. Moreover, noc-turnal continuous epileptiform EEG discharges maycause severe LD and an autistic-like picture.Drugs may induce state-dependent LD in the following\\nways:\\n•Direct effects when drugs like phenobarbital, prim-\\nidone, and benzodiazepines may produce sedation,attention deficits, and mood disorders.\\n•Indirect effects when some adverse effects like\\ndiplopia or irritability, even if they do not affect cog-nition itself, affect the ability to perform cognitivetasks.\\nIf allowed to continue for a long time, state-dependent\\nLD may become permanent; strong evidence for thiscomes from rare models of epilepsy (e.g., the Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep, and the drug-resistant par-tial epilepsies in children and adults), but it is still notknown to what extent a state-dependent LD may becomea permanent LD (5). Both permanent and state-dependentLD can occur simultaneously, for example, if a child withbrain damage also has frequent seizures.\\nLD IN OTHER CLINICAL CONDITIONS\\nThere are reports of a possible association between LD\\nand other chronic disorders, like diabetes mellitus, asthma,brain tumors, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), and immune-mediated disorders, but the prevalence is not documented.For example, the role of diabetes mellitus on learningin children is controversial; some case –control studies,\\nwhich compared patients with type I diabetes with sibil-ings and classmates did not find different scores in aca-demic performance between the groups (33,34). Otherstudies found an increased risk of learning problems indiabetes patients as compared to controls (20,35). Thesignificance of the increased risk of academic impairmentin asthmatic children may be attributed to low attendanceat school, and is proportional to the numbers of attacks(36).\\nNF1 is one of the most common genetic conditions af-\\nfecting the nervous system. Individuals with NF1 tend todevelop peripheral nerve sheath tumors and LD (37). Ac-cording to the DSM IV-TR, a link is reported betweenLD and psychological, behavioral problems. Specifically,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, dys-thymic disorder, and behavioral disorders are involved.Behavioral and mood changes may result from temporaryor permanent cognitive deficits, but may be also the causeof LD (4).\\nPROBLEMS WITH EPIDEMIOLOGICAL\\nSTUDIES OF LD IN EPILEPSY\\nThere are many problems with epidemiological studies\\non LD. The definitions are not standardized and patientswith associated mental retardation may or may not be in-cluded. The patients may be selected and may represent\\nEpilepsia, Vol. 47, Suppl. 2, 2006LEARNING DISORDERS IN EPILEPSY 17\\nmore severe disease variables, leading to an overestimate\\nof LD. Tests used are often different from a study to an-other, and the clinical significance of test results may bedifferent from test to test. These factors may significantlyinfluence the figures for prevalence of LD. Risk factors(e.g., the underlying epileptogenic conditions) and con-founders (e.g., concurrent psychiatric disorders) have tobe recognized. The risk attributable to epilepsy may bedifficult to determine because of the lack of controls insome studies. All these factors may bias the recognitionof LD in patients with epilepsy, compared to the generalpopulation.\\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS\\n•Learning and behavioral problems are more common\\nin children with epilepsy than the general population.\\n•Children with symptomatic epilepsy generally have\\nmore learning problems than children with idiopathicor cryptogenic epilepsies.\\n•The prevalence of LD is an age-related variable; it is\\nhigher in older children and in children with earlierseizure onset.\\n•There is very little information on the prevalence of\\nLD in well-defined pediatric populations with idio-pathic, cryptogenic, and symptomatic epilepsy andin normal individuals.\\n•LD may be permanent or state-dependent: it is im-\\nportant to identify and treat state-dependent LD, al-though successful treatment is not always possible.\\n•By definition, LD in children with epilepsy occur in\\nthose without global mental retardation.\\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\\nHow should we move forward? Future studies should\\nfocus on large and representative samples of patients andmatched controls, to assess better the prevalence of LD (ingeneral and by type) and their different prognoses, the riskof LD attributable to epilepsy, and more specifically to id-iopathic, cryptogenic, and symptomatic epilepsy, the dis-ease characteristics predicting the occurrence of LD (par-tial or generalized, onset of seizures, number of seizures,hemisphere involved), the role of antiepileptic drugs in thedevelopment of seizures, and the effect of frequent EEGepileptiform discharges in causing LD.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

Method\\nData were collected through the Health Proﬁles for Children and\\nYouth in Akershus Study ( www.kunnskapssenteret.no ) (in Norwegian).\\nThe data were cross-sectional and based on self-report from adolescents(13–16 years old) in junior high school in Akershus. The study was basedon a questionnaire, and participation at every level (individual, classes,\\nand schools) was voluntary. A total of 11,021 pupils were invited to par-\\nticipate in the present study, undertaken in Akershus County in 2002 bythe Norwegian Health Services Research Centre. Akershus County, sur-rounding the Norwegian capital Oslo, comprises urban, suburban, and\\nrural areas. All 22 municipalities in the county with a minimum of 1000\\npupils participated. Classes at each school level were selected randomlyto obtain a sample representative of the county as a whole. The question\\nconcerning epilepsy was: ‘‘Have you or have you had epilepsy?’’\\nThe questionnaire comprised 110 questions grouped under diﬀerent\\ntopics: sociodemographic conditions, communication, social networkand school, smoking, alcohol, drug abuse, nutrition and attitude concern-\\ning own body, physical health, psychosocial health, mental health, sexual\\nexperience and knowledge, attitude and use of health services. The parentswere informed by the local school and asked to give their consent. Theadolescents completed the questionnaires themselves during a classroom\\nsession. Sixty-ﬁve schools participated. All questionnaires wereanonymous.\\nWe focused on questions addressing psychiatric symptoms. To assess\\npsychiatric symptoms, we used the SDQ-S, which comprises ﬁve subscales\\neach containing ﬁve items, for a total of 25 items: Hyperactivity scale,Emotional Symptom scale, Conduct Problem scale, Peer Problem scale,\\nand Prosocial scale. High scores on the Emotional Symptom, Conduct\\nProblem, Hyperactivity, and Peer Problem scales increase the risk ofdepression and anxiety, conduct and oppositional disorders, ADHD,and any psychiatric disorder, respectively [34]. Each item is scored 0 for\\n‘‘not true,’’ 1 for ‘‘somewhat true,’’ and 2 for ‘‘certainly true.’’ Positively\\nworded items were rated inversely. This made it possible to combine thescores (0–10) on the ﬁrst four scales (all except the Prosocial scale) to gen-erate a Total Diﬃculty score in the range 0–40. The Prosocial scale mea-\\nsures the adolescent’s ability to act prosocially, independent of the\\ndiﬃculties measured by the other subscales.\\nIt is convenient to classify scores as normal, borderline, and abnormal.\\nAbout 10% of the community sample scored in the abnormal band, 10%\\nscored in the borderline band, and 80% scored in the normal band [35].\\nTo deﬁne a 10% high-risk group (abnormal) and an 80% low-risk group(normal), adjusted cutoﬀ points were used in our Norwegian sample [36].\\nThe SDQ-S also contains an impact supplement. This asks whether the\\nrespondent believes that he or she has a problem (perceived diﬃculties)and, if so, inquires further about overall distress, social impairment, bur-den, and chronicity. This supplement is used to evaluate the seriousness of\\nthe psychiatric symptoms with respect to impact on daily life and possible\\nneed for help. Each item is scored 0 for ‘‘not at all,’’ 0 for ‘‘only a little,’’ 1for ‘‘quite a lot,’’ and 2 for ‘‘a great deal.’’ The one item concerning overalldistress and the four items concerning social impairment are used to gen-\\nerate an impact score ranging from 1 to 10. The impact scores can be\\nsummed to generate a total impact score ranging from 0 to 10. A totalimpact score of P2 or more is abnormal, a score of 1 is borderline, and\\na score of 0 is normal. The Norwegian SDQ-S was translated and back-\\ntranslated by Heiervang et al. ( www.sdqinfo.com ).\\n2.1. Statistical analysis\\nPossible group diﬀerences in continuous and categorical variables were\\ntested using the ttest and vtest, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) for scor-\\ning abnormal or borderline on the SDQ-S were estimated with the use of\\nlogistic regression analysis, with abnormal or borderline score on the\\nSDQ-S as the dependent variable, and age, gender, family aﬄuence (poorvs. well oﬀ), comorbidity (no chronic medical illnesses vs. chronic medicalillness), living with single parent (yes/no), and epilepsy as the independent\\nvariables. Results of multivariate analysis are presented as ORs with 95%\\nconﬁdence intervals and Pvalues. All tests were two-sided and were per-\\nformed at a 5% signiﬁcance level. SPSS for Windows Statistical SoftwareVersion 11.0 was used for all analyses. Missing data in the analysis are due\\nto failure to complete questionnaires.\\n3. Results\\nA total of 11,021 pupils were invited to participate, and\\n9424 responded, yielding a response rate of 86%. Withrespect to the question concerning epilepsy, 8467 adoles-cents responded. One hundred thirty reported having orhaving had epilepsy; i.e., the lifetime prevalence of epilepsyin this group was 13/1000. The mean age was 15.1(range = 13–17) for the epilepsy group and 15.0(range = 13–17) for the control group. Among the adoles-\\ncents with epilepsy, 72 (56%) were male, compared with\\n4212 (51%) among the adolescents without epilepsy.\\nMean scores for emotional problems, conduct problems,\\nhyperactivity/inattention, and peer relationship problemsM.I. Lossius et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 9 (2006) 286–292 287were signiﬁcantly higher among the students with epilepsy.\\nThe Total Diﬃculty Score, which is the sum of the fourscale scores described earlier, was also signiﬁcantly higheramong the adolescents with epilepsy ( Table 1 ). There wasno signiﬁcant diﬀerence with respect to prosocial behavior\\n(Table 1 ).\\nWe used the statistical 80–10–10% banding, deﬁned by\\nFord et al. [35], and adjusted the cutoﬀ scores in our Nor-\\nwegian sample to deﬁne normal, borderline, and abnormal[36]. With respect to the SDQ-S symptom Total Diﬃculty\\nscore, we found that the percentages of borderline and\\nabnormal SDQ-S scores, in all grades, were higher amongadolescents with epilepsy than among controls ( Fig. 1 ).\\nHowever, for the 8th grade, the diﬀerence did not reach sta-tistical signiﬁcance. In the 10th grade, almost 40% of theadolescents with epilepsy scored borderline or abnormalcompared with 17% of the controls.\\nA signiﬁcantly higher percentage of the population with\\nepilepsy scored borderline or abnormal on the impact score\\nand a lower proportion scored normal ( Fig. 2 ). The diﬀer-\\nences were signiﬁcant in the 9th and 10th grades, but not inthe 8th grade. with Adolescents with epilepsy with a nor-mal, borderline, or abnormal symptom score more oftenreported diﬃculties with a serious impact on their daily life(impactP2) than did adolescents without epilepsy ( Table\\n2); that is, it is more diﬃcult for adolescents with epilepsy\\nto cope with psychiatric symptoms. However, the reporting\\nof problems with great impact was statistically signiﬁcantlyhigher, compared with controls, only among the adoles-cents with epilepsy scoring normal on the SDQ-S ( Table 2 ).\\nIn the multivariate logistic regression analysis using epi-\\nlepsy as the independent variable, epilepsy was found to bea signiﬁcant predictor of scoring borderline or abnormalon the SDQ-S, with an OR of 1.8 ( Table 3 ). Low family\\naﬄuence (OR = 1.41, P< 0.001), presence of other disor-\\nders (comorbidity) (OR = 1.25, P< 0.001) and living with\\na single parent (OR = 1.42, P< 0.001) were also signiﬁcant\\npredictors of scoring borderline or abnormal on the SDQ-S, but epilepsy was the strongest predictor.Table 1\\nMean scores on diﬀerent subscales of the SDQ-S for those without\\nepilepsy and those with epilepsy\\nSDQ-S score ( ttest) P\\nNo epilepsy\\n(n= 8264)Epilepsy\\n(n= 124)\\n1.

Discussion\\nIn this study, mean SDQ-S scores of adolescents with\\nepilepsy were signiﬁcantly impaired compared with thoseof control adolescents ( Table 1 ). The higher score in emo-\\ntional problems in adolescents with epilepsy indicates theyhave a greater amount of emotional symptoms. Goodman[34]found that high values on the Emotional Problem scale\\ncorresponded to such psychiatric diagnoses as depression,phobias, and anxiety. The rate of depression in chronic epi-\\nlepsy, as measured by questionnaires, varies from 23% to\\n26% in the literature [37,38] .\\nEttinger and co-workers [38]studied 43 children and\\nadolescents (7–18 years of age) with epilepsy, but withoutknown psychiatric comorbidity, attending an outpatientclinic at a pediatric neurological department. They report-\\ned that 26% of the sample had signiﬁcantly increaseddepression scores and 16% had signiﬁcantly increased anx-iety scores. The ﬁndings were more pronounced in the old-er compared with the younger group. The high rate ofdepression in youth with epilepsy may explain theincreased suicide rates [4,38–40] . In a recent study of chil-\\ndren with epilepsy (5–16 years of age), Caplan and co-\\nworkers [40] reported a suicidal ideation rate of 20%.\\nUnfortunately, there are no data from Norway on the fre-quency of suicidal ideation or suicide in young people withepilepsy.\\nAlthough internal consistency of the SDQ-S scales with\\nrespect to conduct problems was low, possibly as a result ofunderreporting [30], the high scores on the SDQ-S Conduct\\nProblem scale among adolescents with epilepsy indicate\\nthat this patient group may be at high risk of having or\\ndeveloping conduct and oppositional disorders. This is inaccordance with the high externalizing scores reported byHermann et al. [14], Schoenfeld et al. [41], and Austin\\n[42], who demonstrated that about 50% of children (8–11\\nyears of age) with chronic epilepsy have behavioralproblems.\\nAttention problems are reported to be the most common\\nbehavioral problem in children with epilepsy [43]. This is\\nsupported by the high hyperactivity/inattention scorereported in our study. These ﬁndings may indicate anincreased risk of ADHD in youth with epilepsy, which isTable 2\\nImpact of symptoms on those with epilepsy versus those without epilepsy\\nSymptoms score (SDQ-S] Impact score (SDQ-S) Total\\nNormal Borderline Abnormal\\nEpilepsy Normal Count 66 3 10 79b\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea83.5% 3.8% 12.7%\\nBorderline Count 9 1 7 17\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea52.9% 5.9% 41.2%\\nAbnormal Count 11 2 13 26\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea42.3% 7.7% 50.0%\\nTotal Count 86 6 30 122\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea70.5% 4.9% 24.6%\\nNo epilepsy Normal Count 6466 466 449 7381b\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea87.6% 6.3% 6.1%\\nBorderline Count 418 137 248 949\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea52.1% 17.1% 30.9%\\nAbnormal Count 491 110 348 949\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea51.7% 11.6% 36.7%\\nTotal Count 7375 713 1045 9133\\n% within symptom 100%\\nscalea80.8% 7.8% 11.4%\\naNorwegian cutoﬀ.\\nbP= 0.02.\\nTable 3\\nPredictors of scoring abnormal or borderline at SDQ-S Total Diﬃculty\\nsymptom score in a Norwegian population of adolescents (13–16 years ofage) ( n= 8315)\\nVariable OR 95% CI P\\nAge (grade) 1.05 0.88–1.02 0.13\\nGender 1.09 0.81–1.02 0.11\\nFamily aﬄuence 1.41 0.66–0.76 <0.001\\nComorbidity 1.25 1.11–1.40 <0.001Single parent 1.42 0.63–0.79 <0.001\\nEpilepsy 1.82 1.17–.83 0.007M.I. Lossius et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 9 (2006) 286–292 289also reported elsewhere [10]. Dunn et al. reported rates of\\nprevalence of 11.4% for possible ADHD, combined type,and 24% for possible ADHD, predominately inattentivetype [10]. Although the diﬀerences in scores between the\\ntwo groups were not greater on this scale than on the oth-ers, it is nevertheless striking that the mean score in this\\ndimension was high both in the epilepsy group and in the\\ncontrol group. Such results have also been described byothers [34,44] , but in our Norwegian sample the scores\\nwere even higher [36]. The reasons are unclear, but the\\nNorwegian school system, which places little emphasis ondiscipline, may be of importance (for more details, seeRef. [36]).\\nBy using the banding deﬁned by Ford et al. [35], and\\nadjusting for Norwegian conditions in our sample, we\\nfound that, compared with their peers without epilepsy, asigniﬁcantly higher percentage of 9th and 10th graders withepilepsy scored borderline or abnormal on the SDQ-S.Borderline scores indicate a moderate risk, and abnormalscores indicate a high risk, of having or developing psychi-atric disorders [34].\\nThe high Peer Problem and Total Diﬃculty scores in our\\nsample also predispose to psychiatric disorders [34]. Galetti\\net al. [45]reported that adolescents with epilepsy often feel\\ndiscriminated against in school by both teachers and peers.This can be a possible explanation for the increased peerproblems noted in our study. However, other studies havereported no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between adolescents withepilepsy and a control group with respect to self-esteem,aﬀect and self-eﬃcacy [46].\\nA study performed in youth with epilepsy reported\\nimpaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [25].\\nRecently, however, Benavente-Aguilar and co-workers[47]demonstrated that HRQOL was better in adolescents\\nwith epilepsy in a community sample than in youth recruit-ed from specialist clinics.\\nMost studies looking at epilepsy and psychiatric comor-\\nbidity in young people do not segregate children and ado-\\nlescents, and few studies are population based. However, in\\na population survey of British children (5–15 years of age),Davies and co-workers [12]reported frequencies of any\\npsychiatric disorder of 56 and 26% in complicated epilepsyand uncomplicated epilepsy, respectively. They notedincreased frequencies of emotional conduct, ADHD, andpervasive developmental disorders in the epilepsy group(n= 67) compared with a diabetes group ( n= 47) and a\\ncontrol group ( n= 10,202). Unfortunately, our data did\\nnot allow us to diﬀerentiate between complicated epilepsyand uncomplicated epilepsy. We believe that our studydesign and the high response rate in our sample indicatethat our results are representative of adolescents aged 13–16 with all kinds of epilepsy.\\nWe also found that adolescents with epilepsy, although\\nscoring within normal limits on the SDQ-S, reported a\\nhigher impact of their perceived diﬃculties on daily life\\nthan adolescents without epilepsy. This result was alsoreported by Davies and co-workers for children 5–15 yearsold[12], and illustrates that even youth with epilepsy with-\\nout additional psychiatric problems may experience diﬃ-culties in coping with daily life.\\nIn multivariate logistic analyses we found epilepsy to be\\na signiﬁcant predictor of scoring borderline or abnormalon the SDQ-S ( Table 3 ). This is in accordance with Davies\\nand co-workers [12], who found epilepsy, but not diabetes,\\nto be an independent variable (adjusted for age, sex, andsevere learning diﬃculties) associated with all behavioralvariables in regression analyses.\\nIt is important to emphasize that the SDQ-S is an instru-\\nment used to screen for psychiatric symptoms and not adiagnostic tool. It was developed as a multi-informantquestionnaire (parent, teacher, and pupil), but the SDQ-S\\nhas been shown to have acceptable psychometric properties\\n[30–33] . Compliance diﬃculties may have arisen if we had\\ninvolved teachers and parents of the study sample. Ourresults are strengthened by the high response rate and thepopulation-based design, but weakened by the lack of spe-ciﬁc epilepsy characteristics. In addition, the Norwegianversion of the SDQ-S has not yet been clinically validated,although Rønning and co-workers [31]used the SDQ-S in a\\nNorwegian community sample and found the SDQ-S to be\\nan eﬃcient and economical screening instrument for pre-ventive research on large community samples.\\nFurther studies from the United Kingdom [34,48] , Ger-\\nmany [30,31] , Sweden [33,48] , Finland [49], and The Neth-\\nerlands [50] reported generally acceptable psychometric\\nproperties for the SDQ and the SDQ-S with the exceptionof the self-reported conduct problems [32,34,50] . Becker\\nand co-workers [30]found the German version of the\\nSDQ-S to be a reliable and valid method for the assessment\\nof behavioral problems in children and adolescents.\\n5. Conclusion\\nSDQ-S symptom scores for an unselected group of ado-\\nlescents (13–16 years of age) with epilepsy were higher than\\nthose of controls, indicating a higher incidence of psychiat-\\nric problems compared with controls. The wide range ofpsychiatric symptoms in adolescents with epilepsy in oursample indicates that they are at risk of having or develop-ing a wide range of psychiatric disorders such as depres-sion, anxiety, and conduct and oppositional disorders.The adolescents with epilepsy also reported a higher impactof their perceived diﬃculties on daily life than did adoles-\\ncents without epilepsy. This knowledge should give rise\\nto a more detailed study of psychiatric problems in thispopulation and suggests that it is of great importance tohelp and prevent psychiatric problems in adolescents withepilepsy.\\nAcknowledgment\\nWe thank the Norwegian Council for Mental Health,\\nKari Mette Lillestølen, Dag Hofoss, Ann-Soﬁe Eriksson,and Karl Otto Nakken for help and support.290 M.I.

The\\nobjective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ongoing seizures on school\\nattendance amongst children with epilepsy.\\nMethods: This was a prospective study, conducted at the University of Campinas, in\\nthe pediatric epilepsy clinic, from January 2005 to August 2006. We enrolled 50\\nconsecutive children who had a diagnosis of epilepsy. Parents were interviewed by one\\nof the authors using a semi-structured questionnaire that included questions speci-ﬁcally addressing the impact of epilepsy on the child’s academic life.\\nResults: Fifty patients were evaluated, 34 boys and 16 girls; ages ranged from 6 to 18\\nyears old (mean = 11). Eighty-eight percent of patients in the study missed at least 1day of school due to seizures. The reason given by parents for a school absence wasseizure in 75%, medical appointment in 79.5%, epilepsy related tests (EEG, MRI, etc.)\\nin 68.2%, and other in 0.03%. Almost half of the parents (46%) believed that if the child\\nhad a seizure at school he/she should leave school immediately. Sixty percent offamilies allowed the child to skip a school day even if there was no illness and the child\\nhad no seizures on that day. Among those patients with siblings, 12.5% had a brother or\\nsister who was absent from school for at least 1 day due to his/her sibling’s epilepsy.Conclusion: Seizures have a signiﬁcant impact on school attendance, and as a result\\nmay increase the academic difﬁculties faced by children with epilepsy. This effect\\nmay be especially pronounced in children with symptomatic epilepsy and medicallyintractable seizures.#2007 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Other factors that may contribute to poorschool performance amongst epilepsy patients mayinclude overprotective parental attitudes, a lack of\\nacademic motivation, and low self-esteem. The\\nimpact of epilepsy on school attendance may alsocontribute to the academic difﬁculties of childrenwith epilepsy.\\nMost studies addressing academic performance in\\nschool-aged children with epilepsy are focused onacademic achievement.\\n2—4School attendance in\\nchildren with epilepsy, as well as other medical\\nconditions, was evaluated by Msall et al.5, which\\nfound that 4.5—5.5% of children with cerebral palsy,epilepsy, vision and hearing impairment, and com-munication disorders had a negative impact onschool attendance as a result of their medicalimpairments.\\nThe objective of our study was to speciﬁcally\\naddress the impact of seizures on school attendance\\nin children with epilepsy.\\nMethod\\nThis was a prospective study conducted at the\\npediatric epilepsy clinic at our University Hospitalfrom January 2005 to August 2006. We evaluated 50\\nconsecutive children with diagnosis of epilepsy\\nmade according to standards set forth by the Inter-national League Against Epilepsy.\\n6All parents or\\nlegal guardians signed an informed consentapproved by the Ethical Committee of our institu-tion. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of epilepsy,age between 6 and 18 years old, and signature ofinformed consent by a parent or guardian.\\nParents were interviewed by one of the authors\\nusing a structured questionnaire ( Appendix A ) that\\nincluded questions about the impact of epilepsy inthe child’s academic life.\\nStatistical analysis was performed using the\\nFisher exact test, with a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05.\\nResults\\nFifty patients were evaluated, 34 boys and 16 girls,with ages ranging from 6 to 18 years (mean = 11).The types of epileptic syndrome included in thestudy were idiopathic in 13 patients, cryptogenicin 18 patients, and symptomatic in 19 patients.T wenty patients had a co-morbid diagnosis of devel-\\nopmental delay.\\nThe antiepileptic medications prescribed to\\npatients included in the study were carbamazepinein 18, clobazam in 18, valproate in 11, lamotrigine in8, topiramate in 7, oxcarbazepine in 5, phenytoin in\\n4, phenobarbital in 2, clonazepam in 2, and nitra-zepam in 1 patient. T wenty-three patients were onpoly-therapy.\\nForty-four (88%) patients missed at least one\\nschool day due to various reasons attributable toepilepsy. The reason for school absence was a seizurea few hours before going to school in 30 (60%)patients, medical appointment in 31 (62%) patients,epilepsy-related tests (EEG, MRI, blood work, etc.) in26 (52%) patients, and hospitalization in 2 patients.\\nThirty (60%) patients had at least one seizure at\\nschool, and 2/3 of these patients went home after\\nhaving a seizure while at school. According to parentresponses, 23 (46%) believe that their child shouldgo home immediately after having a seizure atschool, and 12 (24%) believed that their child’steachers were uncomfortable or apprehensiveabout their child’s epilepsy diagnosis. In addition,35 (70%) parents admitted that they would permit\\nthe child to miss a school day even if he or she had no\\nseizure or other health problems that day. Ten (20%)parents reported that they were advised by facultyat the child’s school that it would be better prefer-able to choose permanent home schooling instead ofcontinuing in a mainstream, classroom setting.\\nForty (80%) patients had at least one sibling.\\nAmongst the siblings of patients with epilepsy,\\n12.5% had missed a school day due to his or her\\nsibling’s epilepsy. Tables 1—3 summarized the\\nimpact of seizures study patients’ academic lifeaccording to seizure control, the type of epilepticseizure, and neurological development.\\nDiscussion\\nSchool performance can be inﬂuenced by manyvariables that are differentially present in childrenwith epilepsy. The cognitive impact caused by fre-quent seizures, the underlying disease process pro-ducing seizures, and the cognitive effects ofantiepileptic medications may all prevent optimalacademic achievement.\\n2—4However, the impact of\\nseizures frequency on school attendance also plays a\\nrole in the academic underachievement of childrenwith epilepsy. Eighty-eight percent of our patientswere absent from school for at least 1 day as a resultof their epilepsy diagnosis. However , it is interestingto note that in several instances, the absence fromschool could not be justiﬁed by the presence ofongoing seizures. Most of our patients were granted\\nspecial privileges — such as the option to stay home\\nor to leave school whenever they requested to —even when seizures were adequately controlled. Anoverprotective attitude by parents and teachers wasSeizure impact on the school attendance in children with epilepsy 699usually due to the concerns about seizures while at\\nschool, school performance and adverse effects ofantiepileptic drug.\\n7\\nOur data is in keeping with the ﬁnding that\\nalthough teachers’ attitudes about epilepsy are gen-\\nerally positive, there are signiﬁcant deﬁcits in theirgeneral knowledge about epilepsy, its impact in edu-cational settings, and the appropriate managementof epilepsy and seizures in the classroom.\\n8—11In\\naddition, it has been demonstrated that school tea-chers believe that epilepsy has a comparable class-room impact to HIV infection, and that both\\nconditions are felt to be a much greater concern than\\nother chronic health conditions, such as asthma,congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and leu-kemia. Thirty percent of teachers reported that achild with epilepsy would distract the other children\\nin the classroom.\\n10However , although epilepsy has a\\npowerful impact and associated stigma in the aca-demic environment, teachers are eager to receive\\nmore information on epilepsy.\\n12Providing teachers\\nwith accurate information about epilepsy and seizuresafety is a simple intervention that may go far topositively effect the education of pediatric epilepsypatients.\\nSchool performance can be compromised in chil-\\ndren with epilepsy. Uncontrolled epilepsy can causea decline in school results even when the seizures\\nare of short duration and have subtle symptoms.\\n2In\\naddition, patients with symptomatic epilepsy are atincreased risk for educational underachievement.\\n3\\nOur data showed that patients with symptomatic700 B.V .K.

Poor school atten-dance is likely to increase the academic difﬁcultiesfaced by children with epilepsy, especially in chil-dren with symptomatic epilepsy and refractory sei-zures. Improved parental and teacher education\\nabout epilepsy in general and seizure safety speci-\\nﬁcally is needed in order to improve school atten-dance of children with epilepsy. The goal wheneverpossible should be to normalize the life of childrenwith epilepsy as compared to their age and devel-opmentally matched peers. Improving the pediatricepilepsy patient’s educational experience is justone facet in achieving this goal.Acknowledgement\\nBruno Vinı ´ cius Kouhiro Aguiar is a medical\\nstudent and received a grant from FAPESP (grant#05/58108-5).\\nAppendix A.

In a long-term prospective, community-based study ofnewly-diagnosed childhood epilepsy, behavioral assessments(Child Behavior Checklist) were performed in children 8 to 9years after the initial diagnosis of epilepsy to determine theimpact of remission and medication status on behavioralproblems. Children with epilepsy were also compared withsibling controls. A total of 226 children (108 females, 118 males;mean age 13y 1mo [SD 2y 8mo], range 8–17y) with idiopathicor cryptogenic epilepsy were included in the analyses. Onehundred and twenty-eight matched pairs were included inanalyses of case–sibling differences. Lack of remission andcurrent medication use were associated with worse behavioralproblem and competency scores. Lack of remission generallyhad a greater effect than medication use, except for attentionproblems; medication status had the more deleterious effect(p<0.001). Children with epilepsy had significantly worse\\nbehavioral problems and competency scores relative to siblingcontrols. Even in pairs in which the patient was seizure-free andoff medication, significant case–sibling differences persisted formost scales ( p=0.05 to p=0.001). Lack of remission and\\ncontinued use of antiepileptic drugs have a negative influenceon behavioral problems in children with epilepsy but do not fullyexplain the worse scores relative to siblings. This suggests anindependent effect associated with the epilepsy itself. Studies conducted in the 1970s demonstrated high rates of\\nbehavioral disturbances associated with symptomatic orseverely uncontrolled epilepsy.\\n1,2More recent studies of pedi-\\natric epilepsy have focused on cryptogenic and idiopathicepilepsy.\\n3–11These studies have demonstrated an unusually\\nhigh occurrence of a wide range of social, cognitive, behav-ioral, and psychiatric difficulties during the active phase of thedisorder. It is not fully clear, however, whether adverse associa-tions with epilepsy are seen just in association with ongoingseizures and current use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Somestudies found that poorer than expected social and education-al outcomes occur even in individuals with excellent seizurecontrol who are no longer on medication.\\n12–14\\nThe independent contributions of seizure control, medica-\\ntion, and epilepsy itself on behavior or related outcomes have\\nnot been clearly distinguished. We have addressed this issuein the context of a long-term, prospective, community-basedstudy of children initially recruited when first diagnosed withepilepsy. The focus of the current analyses was to: (1) assess\\nthe relative contributions of type of epilepsy, seizure control,\\nand medication status to behavioral problems and to socialcompetencies in children with idiopathic or cryptogenicepilepsy; (2) determine whether children with epilepsy had\\nhigher levels of behavioral symptomatology and lower socialcompetencies compared with matched sibling controls with-out epilepsy; (3) determine whether children with epilepsy\\nwere more likely than their sibling controls to have scoresindicative of clinically significant problems; and (4) determinewhether, in children who were completely seizure-free andno longer on AEDs, there was any evidence of higher behav-ioral symptomatology relative to sibling controls. \\nMethod\\nThe Connecticut Study of Epilepsy is a community-basedcohort study that recruited 613 children between 1993 and1997 and has followed them prospectively since then.Children were identified from the practices of 16 of the 17pediatric ne urologists in the state of Connecticut, as well as\\npediatricians and adult neurologists who occasionally provid-\\ned care for children with epilepsy without consulting a pedi-\\natric neurologist. In the USA, a pediatrician is a primary carephysician. Pediatric neurologists represent a first level ofreferral and are commonly consulted for new onset epilepsy.Details of the methods, recruitment, and follow-up for this\\nstudy have been published previously.\\n15 Medical records of all\\nchildren are reviewed on an ongoing basis and re-evaluation of\\nthe underlying etiology and type of epilepsy occurs as new\\ninformation emerges. \\nBetween March 2002 and February 2006, we invited study\\nparticipants to take part in a comprehensive reassessmentprotocol. We also sought to enroll a sibling without a neuro-logical disability as a control, preferably one who was within3 years of the patient’s age. Our protocol included a behav-\\nioral assessment with the parent-completed Child BehaviorChecklist (CBCL),\\n16valid for ages 6 to 18 years. \\nThe CBCL provides a Total problem score as well as\\nInternalizing and Externalizing problem scores, reflecting theextent of behavior symptomatology. It also yields eight nar-rower scales: representing Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, ThoughtProblems, Attention Problems, Rule-breaking Behavior, and\\nAggressive Behavior; six Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nDevelopmental Medicine & Child Neurology 2007, 49:  487–492 487See end of paper for list of abbreviations.Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented scales for Affective, Anxiety,\\nSomatic, Attention-deficit hyperactivity, Oppositional Defiantand Conduct Disorders; and four competency scales:Activities, Social, School, and Total. Raw scores are convertedto Tscores and standardized for age and sex, with a mean of 50\\nand a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher problem and DSM-oriented scores indicate higher levels of behavioral symp-tomatology, and lower competency scores indicate worsecompetency levels. In addition, scores can be dichotomized toindicate whether the level of behavioral problems is clinicallysignificant or not (‘clinical indicator’) based upon cut-offpoints that identified the most extreme 10% in a large norma-tive national sample. The clinical indicators are highly correlat-ed with diagnosed clinical pathology.\\n16\\nOnly pairs in which the case with epilepsy and sibling con-\\ntrol were both assessed with the CBCL were included inmatched analyses. We used the CBCL for 18-year-old partici-pants only when a younger sibling was available who could beassessed with the CBCL, thus permitting inclusion in thecase–sibling analyses. Similarly, an 18-year-old sibling receivedthe CBCL when a younger case with epilepsy was similarlyassessed. We used a different adult measure for cases and sib-lings aged 18 and older (not reported here). \\nOnly cases with cryptogenic or idiopathic epilepsy with a\\npopulation-norm IQ (generally based on a Full-scale IQ>70when available, or a clinical or educational assessment) wereeligible for these analyses. In addition, cases with crypto-genic forms of one of the epileptic encephalopathies wereexcluded because they are generally associated with severeimpairments\\n17and our objective was to focus on children\\nwith epilepsy without other impairments that can often beassociated with behavioral problems. \\nRemission status was classified as being seizure-free for at\\nleast 5 years or not at the time of the assessment. Medicationstatus was classified as either taking or not taking an AED at thetime of the assessment.\\nThe ethics committees of all participating institutions\\napproved all procedures used in this study. Written informedconsent was obtained from the parent and written assent fromthe child, both to participate in the original study and separate-ly to participate in the assessments performed 8 to 9 years later.\\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\\nPrimary outcomes were the overall Internalizing and Exter-\\nnalizing CBCL scales. We examined individual (or narrower)scales to identify whether effects observed on the main out-come scales were due to selective effects in a few domains orwhether they represented more pervasive influences. \\nIn the first set of analyses, we examined factors associated\\nwith scores indicating higher levels of problems within theepilepsy group. The primary focus of the analyses was the T\\nscore. To determine whether differences in mean T scores\\nresulted in potentially important clinical differences, we alsostudied the dichotomous clinical indicator for each scale. \\nAnalyses were performed using SAS (version 9.1). Within\\nthe case group, bivariate analyses of T scores were performed\\nwith the use of t-tests and one-way analyses of variance.\\nMultivariable analyses were performed with multiple linearregression. For analysis of the clinical indicators, we used χ\\n2\\ntests for unpaired control.\\nIn matched analyses, we examined differences between\\ncases and matched siblings. We first constructed a case minussibling difference score. Matched t-tests were used to test\\ncase–sibling differences. Multiple linear regression, with thedifference score as the outcome, was used to test multipledeterminates of case–sibling differences simultaneously. Forthe clinical indicators, associations were summarized with amatched odds ratio (OR) and statistical significance deter-mined with McNemar’s χ\\n2or an exact method.18Confidence\\nintervals (CI) for matched ORs were calculated according tothe methods described by Miettinen.\\n19\\nResults Of the original 613 children in the cohort, 305 (50%) were eligi-ble for this analysis because they had idiopathic or cryptogenicepilepsy and their syndromes did not fall within the category ofepileptic encephalopathy. In addition, they were of normalintelligence and less than 18 years old at the time they wereincluded or would have been eligible for inclusion in thisassessment. Thirty-four (11%) children were no longer inactive follow-up at the time this assessment was performed. Ofthe 271 who were actively followed-up, 226 (83%) participatedin the behavioral assessment with the CBCL. \\nEligible cases who were actively followed but who did not\\nparticipate in the CBCL behavioral assessment ( n=45) were\\nhighly comparable with cases who did participate ( n=226)\\nwith respect to epilepsy syndrome ( p=0.93), sex ( p=0.80),\\nprobability of being at least 5 years seizure-free ( p=0.74), and\\nprobability of having intractable epilepsy ( p=0.47). There was\\na trend for participating cases to be younger than non-partici-pating cases by about 1 year at the time of first seizure ( p=0.02)\\nand by 9 months at time of diagnosis ( p=0.05).\\nSibling controls were obtained for 128 cases. When controls\\nwere not obtained it was usually because one was not available(only child), the only available sibling also had epilepsy, or thecontrol child was too young or too old for the CBCL. Two addi-tional 18-year-old cases with younger sibling controls were alsoincluded for CBCL analyses.\\nThere were 108 (48%) females and 118 (52%) males. Mean\\nage at time of assessment was 13 years 1 month (SD 2y 8mo,range 8–18y). Of this group, 158 (70%) had been seizure-freefor 5 years and 170 (75%) were no longer taking AEDs whenthey and their parents participated in the assessment. Only sixchildren were taking multiple AEDs. Epilepsy syndromegroups included: idiopathic localization-related ( n=39, 17%);\\ncryptogenic focal ( n=109, 48%); idiopathic generalized\\n(n=60, 27%); and other (usually unclassified; n=18, 8%). \\nCBCL scores, already adjusted for sex and age in the popula-\\ntion, did not vary by these factors in our study group.Syndrome group was not associated with any of the CBCLscores and findings for this factor are not presented or furtherdiscussed. \\nCompared with children who who had been seizure-free for\\n5 years, children who were less than 5 years seizure-free hadscores indicative of higher behavioral problem levels for theTotal and Externalizing scores, as well as for five of the eight nar-\\nrow scales and four of the six DSM-oriented scales. They alsohad lower scores for three of the four competence scales. Beingon medication was associated with higher (worse) Total(p=0.02) and Externalizing scores ( p=0.02). Of the eight nar-\\nrower scores, medication use was associated only with higherattention problem scores for both CBCL ( p=0.003) and DSM-\\noriented ( p=0.01) scales.

Cases hadhigher (better) scores on the Social/Activities competencyscale, and were significantly more likely than their sibling con-trols to have scores in the clinically significant range for the\\nTotal, Internalizing, and Externalizing scales, and for six of\\nthe narrower scales as well as four of the DSM-oriented scalesand one of the competency scores (School). \\nIn pairs for which the cases had been seizure-free for at\\nleast 5 years and off medication ( n=85 pairs), statistically\\nsignificant mean case–control differences persisted for theTotal and Internalizing scales, five of the eight narrower\\nscales, four of the six DSM-oriented scales, and three of thefour competency scales. As before, the Activities scale indi-cated better competency in this area for cases compared withtheir siblings. In this reduced sample, few of the matched ORsfor comparing the occurrence of clinically significant find-ings in cases versus controls were statistically significant;however, all but one were in the direction of higher problemlevels among patients. \\nDiscussion\\nAmong cases diagnosed with epilepsy between 8 and 9 years\\nearlier, there are modest associations between behavioral\\nscores and the cases’ remission and medication status.\\nRemission status appears to have a somewhat more pervasive\\neffect than medication status, which seems to be more selective\\nfor attention disorders and school performance. These associa-\\ntions do not, however, explain the higher level of behavioralproblems in children with epilepsy relative to sibling con-\\ntrols. Even in case–control pairs in which the case had been at\\nleast 5 years seizure-free and completely off medications (bymost measures, an excellent outcome after 8–9 years), mostof the case–sibling differences persisted. Further, these dif-ferences were not simply a matter of marginally worse scoresbut actually translated into more children in the epilepsygroup being in the clinically significant range compared withtheir sibling control, as shown in Table II.\\nPrevious studies of behavioral problems in children with\\nepilepsy have been either in newly-diagnosed patients\\n9,20or\\nin prevalent, clinic-based samples of predominately activeepilepsy on treatment.\\n5,7,11Although seizure frequency and\\nmedication were often examined, the analyses did not clear-ly distinguish these characteristics from the epilepsy itself.On the other hand, several studies have examined social,educational, and employment outcomes in adults who, yearspreviously as children, had epilepsy.\\n12–14,21,22These studies\\nfocused on individuals with intelligence levels comparable to\\nthe population norm and either idiopathic or cryptogenic\\nepilepsy. Many were completely seizure-free and off medica-\\ntion. All found that these young adults did less well thanappropriately selected controls. \\nRecent studies have examined a variety of psychiatric and\\nother disorders in children with newly-diagnosed seizures.These studies found that disorders such as attention-deficit– hyperactivity disorder, depression, school, cogni-\\ntive disturbances, and even migraine may pre-date the onset\\nof seizures.\\n23–27This raises important questions about the\\nvery nature of the association between epilepsy and a variety ofdisorders. Because these recent studies have not yet followed\\nparticipants into adulthood, it is unclear how persistent theseearly indications of difficulties are, and whether these difficul-ties identified at initial diagnosis explain the unexpectedlypoor outcomes in adults with childhood epilepsy in remissionand no longer under treatment.\\n12–14,21,22For example, one\\nstudy reported that problems present at initial diagnosis didnot persist a year later.\\n28\\nOur assessments were performed in the context of a large\\nprospective community-based study. Although our measure ofbehavior was taken at one point in time, the children in thisstudy were actively recruited on a community-wide basis andprospectively followed with equal intensity, regardless of theirseizure or other outcomes. Loss to follow-up after 8 to 9 yearshas been quite modest, and of those who were actively fol-lowed and eligible for these analyses, more than 80% partici-pated in the behavioral assessment. Furthermore, there was noevidence to suggest that those who participated versus thosewho did not differed substantially from each other. Con-sequently, the potential for differential participation in thebehavioral assessment based on seizure or any other type ofoutcome is greatly limited by design, and we were able to pro-vide an assessment in an unselected, representative sample ofchildren midway to adulthood when most were alreadyseizure-free and no longer taking medication. \\nThe behavioral data for our study were not collected in\\nthe context of parents just having received the news of theirchildren being diagnosed with epilepsy, a factor that couldpotentially influence reporting in newly-diagnosed patients.Comparisons were also made with sibling controls, thusgreatly reducing potential confounding influences of familialand environmental factors. With these factors in mind, ourfinding of higher levels of behavioral problems in childrenwho are seizure-free and off medication relative to their sib-ling control provides further evidence regarding the concerns\\nraised in long-term follow-up studies of newly-diagnosedepilepsy,\\n12–14,21,22that there are essential comorbidities associ-\\nated with epilepsy itself that have an impact on the individualindependent of seizures and medication. \\nAlthough the CBCL is not the same as a full psychiatric\\nassessment, it is a well-validated and widely used instrument.In fact, several recent studies of children with epilepsy haveused it, making it possible to compare results directly withthese studies.\\n7,9,29The CBCL is relatively easy to use and is high-\\nly appropriate for large-scale research projects such as this one.While we might have attempted a more intensive and lengthydiagnostic interview, that was not feasible within the context ofthe assessment that we performed. For these reasons, theCBCL was felt to be the best instrument in this setting.\\nInterpretation from multiscale measures must also be per-\\nformed cautiously in light of the multiple hypotheses testedand the intercorrelations among the scales. Our approach tointerpretation of the findings was conservative. The Total,Internalizing, and Externalizing scales were the primary focus,and the narrower scales provided evidence of pervasivenessor selectivity of an effect. The finding that attention and schoolcompetency were the most consistently and most stronglyaffected (many of these associations would be statisticallysignificant even with a Bonferroni correction) is consistentwith several other reports.\\n23,24,30We note, however, that these\\ntwo scores were highly correlated with each other ( r=–0.64 in\\nour sample), so the findings of statistical significance for each\\nBehavioral Problems and Epilepsy  Anne T Berg et al. 491are not independent of each other. In regression models con-\\ntaining remission and medication status, these two factorswere independently associated with school competencyscores. This is potentially noteworthy from a clinical perspec-tive if current school competency is predictive of future educa-tional and employment attainment. This would be worthfurther investigation in future studies. Our primary interest,however, has been in a broad pattern of findings (rather than asingle scale), which indicates higher levels of behavioral prob-lems in most domains for children with epilepsy comparedwith their sibling control.\\nConclusion\\nThe epilepsies are a set of complex disorders with complexconsequences to the individual. The link between problemsand disorders found at the time of initial diagnosis or afterseveral years during adolescence, and those found in youngadults, is not easy to establish and will require extended fol-low-up of this and other cohorts. Understanding this linkcould have tremendous practical implications for diagnosis,management, treatment, and counseling of young patientsand their families. This may, in turn, ultimately lead to improv-ing long-term educational, employment, and other social out-comes in young people who have had epilepsy. \\nAccepted for publication 31st January 2007.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis study was fully supported by a grant from the National Institutesof Health (NINDS RO1-NS31146).

Iloejeb\\naDepartment of Paediatrics, Ebonyi State University, Abakiliki, Nigeria\\nbDepartment of Paediatrics, University Of Nigeria, Enugu, Nigeria\\nSummary\\nThe academic performance and intelligence quotient (IQ) of 50 children with epilepsy aged between\\n5 and 14 years, attending normal primary schools in Enugu, were compared with those of theirnon-epileptic classmates. The academic performance was assessed using the overall scores achieved in\\nterminal examinations in the 2001–2002 academic year. IQ was assessed using the Draw-A-person Test.\\nThe influences of school absence rate, Rutter behavioural scores, socio-economic status and seizure-related variables on academic performance were then determined. Twenty-six percent of the childrenwith epilepsy had a low overall score, and therefore poor academic performance, compared with 16% of\\nthe controls ( p¼0.35). The mean IQ of the children with epilepsy was significantly lower than that of\\nthe controls ( p¼0.02). The mean school absence rate for the children with epilepsy was significantly\\nhigher than that of the controls ( p¼0.001). The mean Rutter score of the children with epilepsy was\\nsignificantly higher than that for the controls ( p<0.001). On multiple linear regression analysis, only\\nIQ (p¼0.01) and seizure type ( p¼0.03) had significant predictive effects as risk factors for low overall\\nscores and poor academic performance. It is concluded that the academic performance of epilepticchildren is influenced by their IQ and type of seizures rather than by other seizure variables or\\nsocio-demographic characteristics.\\nIntroduction\\nEpilepsy is the most common chronic neurological\\ndisease seen in Paediatrics Neurology Units indeveloping countries [1, 2] and has a prevalence of5–10/1000 in developing countries [3].\\nEpilepsy, like other chronic disorders such as sickle\\ncell disease, diabetes mellitus and bronchial asthmahas been found to negatively affect school attendanceand academic performance [4–6]. While academic\\nunder-achievement and poor school attendance in\\nchildren with other chronic conditions are due torecurrent morbidity, the effect of epilepsy is thoughtto be due to relatively reduced intelligence, psycho-social problem, anti-epileptic medication and theinfluence of seizure variables such as seizure type, ageat onset, EEG findings and seizure control [7].However, there is a controversy regarding the relative\\nimportance of these factors [8–10].\\nIn another study, the academic performance of\\nchildren with epilepsy was investigated. The present\\nstudy was undertaken to determine the factors thatinfluences the academic performance of epileptic\\nchildren attending normal primary schools in Enugu.It is hoped that the findings from this study will aidin formulating a suitable educational programmefor these children.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThis controlled study was carried out between\\n2 January and 29 July 2002. Fifty consecutivechildren who presented at the Paediatric Neurologyclinic of University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital(UNTH), Enugu and had epileptic seizures conform-ing to those described by the International LeagueAgainst Epilepsy (ILAE) [11] were recruited to thestudy if they met the set criteria. All the childrenshould have been attending the Paediatric Neurologyclinic of UNTH, Enugu, for at least 2 years, orshould have been seizure free and should have been\\nconsidered fit for discontinuation of anti-epileptic\\ndrug therapy, but were being followed up. These gaveone the opportunity to assess seizure control. Theywere also attending normal primary schools inEnugu. Excluded from the study were children withother defined chronic diseases like sickle cell disease,bronchial asthma, tuberculosis and cerebral palsy inassociation with epilepsy. This was necessary becausethese diseases on their own are known to affect\\nCorrespondence: R. C.

Alsoexcluded from the study were those attending specialinstitutions including institutions for the handi-capped, and normal schools outside Enugu.\\nControls, who were class mates of the children\\nwith epilepsy, matched for age, sex and socio-economic status, were selected using the methodproposed by Richard and Burlew [5]. The academicperformance was assessed using the method pro-posed by Ogunfowora as previously documented [6].\\nThe number of days each child was absent from\\nschool was documented. High and low absences, assuggested by Weitzman, et al. [13], were defined as\\nbeing absent for more than 12 days and less than 12days from school, respectively, in a year. Theintelligence quotient (IQ) of the subjects wereassessed using the Draw-A-Person Test (DAPT)validated for Nigerian children [14], in which aDraw-a-person quotient /C2175% was considered as\\nnormal, while the behaviour of each child wasassessed using the Rutter’s behavioural scale (B2)for children (Teachers scale) as standardized forNigerian children [15]. Rutter’s score of /C2110 was\\nregarded as abnormal. Oyedeji’s method was used in\\nsocial classification [16].\\nSeizure-related factors were obtained from the case\\nrecords. Information obtained included seizure type,age at onset of seizure, seizure frequency at diagnosis\\nand at the time of the study, seizure control, anti-\\nepileptic drugs and EEG findings.\\nSeizure frequency was classified into <6/year,\\n6–24/year and >24/year as suggested by Iloeje [17].\\nPatients with generalized tonic clonic (GTC) seizures\\nreceived phenobarbitone or sodium valproate, those\\nwith partial seizures were on carbamazepine, andthose with absence seizures were placed on etho-suximide or sodium valproate. Some childrenreceived more than one type of drugs, but mono-therapy was the treatment of choice. Seizure controlwas also classified into good control if there was/C2180% reduction in seizure frequency from that at\\npresentation, while it is fair if the reduction wasbetween 51% and 79%, and poor if the reductionwas/C2050% in line with the criteria used by Iloeje [17].\\nEEG findings were categorized into normal andabnormal [17].\\nThe Ethical Committee of UNTH, Enugu,\\napproved the study and informed verbal consentwas obtained from parents/care givers. Analysis wasperformed using SPSS version 11.0. Means werecompared using Students’ t-test. Chi-square test was\\nused for association. Yate’s corrected Chi-square-test\\nor Fisher’s exact test was used as appropriate.Multiple linear regression analysis was used todetermine the factors with predictive effect(s) onacademic performance. p<0.05 was taken as statis-\\ntical significance.Results\\nDemographic characteristics\\nFifty children with epilepsy and fifty controls\\nwere drawn from 37 primary schools in Enugu.\\nThere were 36 (72%) males and 14 (28%) females,(male: female ratio 1.5: 1). The age range wasbetween 5 and 14 years. There was no significant\\ndifference between the distribution of epileptic\\nchildren and control, with regards to socio-economicstatus ( /C31\\n2¼1.11, p¼0.77). The most common was\\nGTC seizures (58%), followed by complex partial(CP) seizure (20%). Mixed epilepsy and simple\\npartial seizure occurred in 12% of the children in\\nequal ratio (6% each). The rest were tonic seizure(4%), simple absence (1%), atypical absence (1%)and atonic seizure (1%).\\nAcademic performance\\nThirteen (26%) children with epilepsy and8(16%) controls were low scorers; and hencehad poor academic performance. However, the\\ndifference in their academic performance was not\\nstatistically significant ( /C31\\n2¼2.1, df ¼2,p¼0.35)\\n(Table 1).\\nInfluence of non-seizure-related variables\\nIntelligence. Nineteen (38%) children with epilepsy\\nand 14(28%) controls had a DAPQ of <75%. The\\ndifference was not statistically significant ( /C312¼1.13,\\ndf¼1,p¼0.29). The mean DAPQ for the subjects\\nwas 82.03 /C620.3%, while that of controls was\\n91.9/C624.8%. The difference was statistically signifi-\\ncant ( t¼2.42, df ¼49,p¼0.02).\\nThe relationship between overall class score and\\nDAPQ among the children with epilepsy was also\\nstatistically significant ( /C312¼7.62, df ¼2,p¼0.02),\\nwhile that between DAPQ and overall score in thecontrols was not significant ( /C312¼2.32, df ¼2,\\np¼0.3) (Table 2).\\nSchool absence.

Among the\\ncontrols, no variable had a predictive effect on\\nacademic performance.\\nDiscussion\\nThe mean DAPQ of children with epilepsy was\\nsignificantly lower than that of the controls(82vs. 91.9%), but that of the children with epilepsy\\nwas nonetheless within the normal range [14]. Thispattern has been reported previously [7, 18]. Thecause of reduced intelligence in children with epilepsy\\nin this study was not specifically evaluated.\\nEllenberg, et al. [18] have reported that seizures per\\nsedo not necessarily cause intellectual deterioration.\\nHowever, the aetiology of the seizures such asneurological insults and malformations may contri-bute to intellectual impairment [17, 18].\\nThere was a significant relationship between\\nDAPQ and academic performance among thechildren with epilepsy in this study. This agreeswith the observation of Sturniolo and Galleti [19],but contrasts somewhat with the observation of\\nSeidenberg, et al. [7]. who noted that children with\\nepilepsy made less progress than expected for theirIQ level and age. The correlation of scholasticachievement with IQ level is not unexpected and IQcould be used in the proper placement ofschool children, particularly at the outset of theireducation [20].\\nSchool absenteeism was significantly more\\nfrequent in children with epilepsy than controls inthis study. Since the children were not admitted inany hospital during the period of this study, thereason for the high rate of school absenteeism could\\nbe due to psychosocial factors rather than severity of\\nthe illness [21].\\nAlthough Mykleburst [22] is of the opinion that\\nschool attendance is a critical factor in school success\\namong children with epilepsy, the correlationbetween them has not been established [8, 23]. Thelack of a significant relationship between academicperformance and school absenteeism in this studyagrees with the latter opinion.\\nThe children with epilepsy in our study had a high\\nrate of behavioural problems, 48% compared with12% among the controls. The fact that behaviouralproblems are more common among children withepilepsy has been previously reported [24–26].\\nHowever, the prevalence of behavioural problems\\nfound in this study (48%) is higher than the 20–30%reported previously in other areas [24, 25]. Thereason for the higher rate in our patients is not veryobvious, but could be due to peer non-acceptance,negative teachers’ attitude and social stigmatization,which have been reported by Ojinnaka [27] inNigeria.\\nTABLE 4\\nRelationship between overall academic score and\\nanti-epileptic drug therapy\\nAnti-epileptic drug regimen Overall score\\nLow Average High Total\\nMonotherapy 11 16 13 40\\nCarbamazepine 0 7 5 12\\nPhenobarbitone 10 7 8 25\\nOthersa120 3\\nPolytherapy 2 3 5 10\\nTotal 13 19 18 50\\naValproate 2 (low score 1, average score 1), ethosuximide\\n1 (average score); statistics: carbamazepine vs. pheno-\\nbarbitone: /C312¼6.58, df ¼2,p¼0.01; monotherapy\\nvs. polytherapy: /C312¼0.59, df ¼2,p¼0.75.\\nTABLE 5\\nResults of multiple regression analysis of factors associated with academic performance in children with epilepsy\\nVariable Coefficient R2change 95% confidence Interval Partial coefficient p\\nDAPQ 0.39 0.13 0.20–1.04 0.40 0.01\\nSeizure type 0.29 0.09 0.01–0.24 0.31 0.03R.

Thisis in keeping with the findings of Sturniolo andGalleti [19], but differs from those of Seidenberg\\net al. [7] and Sofijanov [28] who noted that academic\\nunder-achievement was worse in children withgeneralized epilepsy.\\nThere was no significant difference between\\nmonotherapy and polytherapy in their relationship\\nwith academic performance in this study. Thisfinding differs from previous studies which reportedthat cognitive function was worse in children on\\npolytherapy [29, 30]. The reason could be because a\\nmajority of the children on monotherapy in thisstudy were receiving phenobarbitone. Children onphenobarbitone were significantly more likely to\\nhave a poor academic performance. Previous reports\\non the effects of anti-epileptic medications areconflicting [31–33]. Each of the four drugs used inthis study has been reported to have detrimental\\neffects by some authors [33, 34] but not by others\\n[35, 36]. However, phenobarbitone is the major drugassociated with a detrimental effect on academicperformance [25]. The reason for poor academicperformance among children on phenobarbitone may\\nbe because it reduces attention and memory, and\\ncauses behavioural disorders [31, 32].\\nThe other factors which did not significantly\\ninfluence overall score in this study included sex,\\nsocio-economic status, seizure frequency, age at onset\\nof seizures, seizure control, EEG findings and historyof previous episodes of status epilepticus. This trendhas been reported previously [7, 19, 26].\\nMultiple linear regression showed that only IQ and\\nseizure type had significant predictive effects onacademic performance. This agrees with the knownrelationship between IQ and academic achievement\\n[19, 20] and the recognized effect of generalized\\nseizures on intellectual ability [7, 28]. Previous studieson the academic performance of epileptic childrenusing multiple regression either showed IQ as the\\nonly factor with independent effect [19] or that none\\nof the factors had a strong predictive value onacademic achievement [7]. However, the later studydid not include IQ among the variables analysed.\\nIn conclusion, IQ and seizure type are the most\\nimportant determinants of the academic achievementin children with epilepsy attending normal primaryschools.\\nPreschool IQ evaluation should therefore be\\nconducted in all Nigerian children with epilepsy todetect those who cannot cope in normal schools,since IQ significantly affects their performance.\\nThese children should be identified and offerededucational assistance in normal schools.\\nReferences\\n1.

While there have been\\ndocumented improvements in public attitudes to-\\nwards epilepsy, the remnants of “old” ideas about\\nepilepsy continue to inform popular concepts re-\\nsulting in a difﬁcult social environment for those\\naffected. The social and quality of life problemsarising from a diagnosis of epilepsy can represent\\ngreater challenges than are warranted by its clini-\\ncal severity. The relationship between stigma and\\nimpaired quality of life is well documented. Tack-\\nling the problem of stigma effectively requires that\\nall three of different levels at which it operates are\\nsystematically addressed.\\nKEY WORDS: Stigma ,Public attitudes ,Quality of\\nlife.\\nFor many people with epilepsy, the continuing social\\nreality of their condition is as a stigma. Stigma refers\\nto the loss of status that arises from being in posses-\\nsion of an attribute, for example a health condition,\\nthat has been culturally defined as “undesirably differ-\\nent” and so as “deeply discrediting” (Goffman, 1963).\\nAp e r s o n ’ sp e r c e p t i o n so fs t i g m ac a nr e s u l tf r o mp r e -\\nvious negative experience or from anticipation of future\\nnegative experience. It is insufficient only to consider\\nstigma perceptions of those affected by a particular health\\ncondition, since stigma operates at different levels, defined\\nby Muhlbauer (Muhlbauer, 2002) as the internalized, the\\ninterpersonal, and the institutional (Table 1).\\nINTERPERSONAL ASPECTS\\nOFEPILEPSY STIGMA :\\nPUBLIC ATTITUDES\\nThe association of epilepsy to stigma extends far back\\nin time and across many cultures (Temkin, 1971). In an-\\ncient and primitive societies, epilepsy was often believed to\\noriginate from malignant causes and to be associated with\\nsin or demonic possession. Seizures were often considered\\nbad omens.

Even when biomed-\\nical explanations for epilepsy replaced these earlier mag-\\nical ones, the new paradigm brought its own associations\\nto stigma, with studies linking epilepsy to aggressive or\\ncriminal behavior, abnormal sexual activity, hereditary de-\\ngeneracy, and a specific “epileptic personality.” These\\nexplanations have reinforced negative stereotypes and per-\\npetuated stigma.\\nRecent studies worldwide have found improvements\\nin public attitudes towards epilepsy, even though levels\\nof knowledge have remained fairly static (Jacoby, 2002);\\nhowever, remnants of the “old” ideas continue to inform\\npopular concepts of epilepsy, resulting in continuing mis-\\nperceptions and negative attitudes. In Austria, 15% of\\nsurvey respondents would object to their child marrying\\nap e r s o nw i t he p i l e p s y( S p a t te ta l . ,2 0 0 5 ) .I nt h eC z e c h\\nRepublic (Novotna & Rektor, 2002) 29% still consider\\nepilepsy to be a form of insanity. In the U.K., more than\\nhalf of 1,600 randomly selected informants agreed that\\npeople with epilepsy are treated differently, including by\\nsocial avoidance and exclusion—and they attributed this\\nin part to fears about their unreliability and nonnormal-\\nity (Jacoby et al., 2004). Over a fifth agreed that people\\nwith epilepsy have more personality problems than those\\nwithout. The prevalence of such negative attitudes is suf-\\nficiently high as to suggest that most people with epilepsy\\nwill encounter them fairly routinely.\\nAU . S .s t u d yi n v o l v i n gan a t i o n w i d er a n d o ms a m p l eo f\\n758 adults found four underlying dimensions that char-\\nacterized current attitudes about epilepsy (Dilorio et al.,\\n67\\nSocial Stigma of Epilepsy\\nTable 1. Levels of stigma (Muhlbauer, 2002)\\n•Internalized stigma is felt within the person with the condition and reﬂects their feelings, thoughts, beliefs and fears about being different.\\n•Interpersonal stigma occurs in interactions with others both within and external to the family system; and in these interactions the person\\nwith the illness is treated differently and negatively because of the health condition.\\n•Institutionalized stigma reﬂects indirect expressions of different treatment of persons with an illness as a group in the larger society,\\ne.g. discrimination of persons with epilepsy by policies of an insurance company.\\n2004). First, negative stereotypes reflected beliefs that\\nother people hold about people with epilepsy: for example,\\npeople with epilepsy are unreliable or should not marry.\\nSecond, risk and safety concerns reflected the public’s un-\\nderlying worries about potential harms if a person with\\nepilepsy engages in certain activities. Third, work and role\\nexpectations reflected beliefs about the ability of persons\\nwith epilepsy to be as successful in work and social roles.\\nFourth, personal fear and social avoidance reflected affec-\\ntive responses such as being nervous around a person with\\nepilepsy or being afraid to be alone with someone with\\nepilepsy. Many (27.3%) believed that there was a high like-\\nlihood of death with every seizure and 66.5% thought they\\nwould need to put something in the person’s mouth during\\nas e i z u r e .L o w e rl e v e l so fk n o w l e d g ea b o u te p i l e p s yw e r e\\nassociated with higher perceptions of stigma. It is clear that\\naddressing negative attitudes on the part of others must in-\\nclude both knowledge-based and emotion-based reactions.\\nAr e c e n ts u r v e yo f1 9 , 0 0 0U . S . A .t e e n a g e r si n d i c a t e d\\nmany held negative perceptions of people with epilepsy—\\nlikely a result of lack of familiarity and knowledge (Austin\\net al., 2002). For example, 52% had never heard of\\nepilepsy, 46% were not sure if it was contagious, and 40%\\nwere not sure if people with epilepsy were dangerous. Only\\n31% reported they would consider dating someone with\\nepilepsy and 75% thought teenagers with epilepsy were\\nmore likely to be bullied or picked on than their healthy\\npeers. One recent U.K. study suggested that some social\\navoidance of teenagers with epilepsy might be related to\\nconcerns about not knowing what do if a seizure should\\noccur (Robson, 2006). When children and adolescents ex-\\nperience the kind of difficult social environment reflected\\nin these expressed attitudes of peers, internalized stigma\\nwould be expected.\\nINSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS\\nOFEPILEPSY STIGMA :RULES\\nANDSANCTIONS\\nLegal discrimination against people with epilepsy dates\\nback for centuries and has included restrictions on mar-\\nriage, fertility, and immigration, which in some countries\\nhave only recently been abandoned. Legal and statutory\\ndiscrimination still operates across some life domains, even\\nthough in many countries epilepsy is now considered as a\\n“prescribed disability” with legal protections. One obviousarea of restriction is employment. In the U.K., people with\\nepilepsy are barred by statutory legislation, from admis-\\nsion to the armed forces; and may face restrictions if they\\nopt for careers in teaching, medicine, the police force, fire\\nbrigade, and prison service. Similarly, worldwide people\\nwith epilepsy face driving restrictions ranging from a total\\nban to the restoration of a license after a fixed period of\\nseizure freedom.\\nINDIVIDUALIZED ASPECTS\\nOFEPILEPSY STIGMA :REACTIONS\\nOFPEOPLE WITHEPILEPSY\\nIt is clear that the social problems and repercussions for\\noverall quality of life can be greater challenges than war-\\nranted by the seizure severity. First, a diagnosis of epilepsy\\nappears often to be interpreted negatively, leading some-\\ntimes to an overwhelming feeling of shame (Schneider and\\nConrad, 1983). Once diagnosed, people with epilepsy ap-\\npear often to operate in expectation of negative reactions\\nand attitudes from others and develop a special “epilep-\\ntic identity” underpinned by these expectations (Scambler,\\n1989). A distinction can be made between “felt” and “en-\\nacted” stigma. Felt stigma refers to the shame of be-\\ning epileptic and the fear of encountering epilepsy-linked\\nenacted stigma; whereas enacted stigma refers to ac-\\ntual episodes of discrimination. Felt stigma may cause\\nmore personal anguish and unhappiness than enacted. Felt\\nstigma may also become a self fulfilling prophecy, in that\\nfear and shame about their epilepsy leads people to conceal\\nit from others and so to deny the opportunity to test whether\\nthe enacted stigma and discrimination they expect will, in\\nfact, materialize (Scambler, 1989). In one study of people\\nwith epilepsy in remission, only 2% could recall any occa-\\nsion of unfair treatment at work and only 3% thought they\\nhad not been successful with a job application because of\\ntheir epilepsy—yet a third felt their epilepsy made it more\\ndifficult for them than for others to gain employment and\\nmany admitted they had not disclosed their condition to\\nemployers out of fear of discrimination (Jacoby, 2002).\\nFamily members, particularly parents, emerge as key\\nfigures in the process by which people with epilepsy come\\nto acknowledge their undesired difference. Their reactions\\nto a diagnosis of epilepsy in their child seem to set the\\nstage for the child’s own interpretation of its significance.\\nWhere parents’ reactions are negative, the child learns\\nEpilepsia ,48(Suppl. 9):6–9, 2007\\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01391.x8\\nA. Jacoby and J. K. Austin\\nto think about epilepsy as something shameful; where\\nparents’ attitudes are that epilepsy will attract hostile re-\\nactions, the child learns that epilepsy is something to keep\\nquiet about. Teachers, healthcare professionals and oth-\\ners may endorse negative attitudes, thus acting as “stigma\\ncoaches” for their affected charges. Not surprisingly, strate-\\ngies adopted by people with epilepsy for managing stigma\\ninclude rejection and/or renegotiation of the diagnosis in\\nfavor of a more socially benign one; social withdrawal\\nand isolation to avoid public exposure of seizures; and re-\\nduction of expectations for the future. Anxiety over other\\npeople’s potentially negative reactions may also lead to\\nconcealment of the condition, “covering” for seizures;\\noverprotection by significant others leading to increased\\ndependency; and “disabling talk” (whereby significant oth-\\ners detail to the person affected by epilepsy the restric-\\ntions it imposes upon them). It is perhaps not surprising\\nthat adults with epilepsy described themselves as less valu-\\nable, less adaptable, less dependable, less mature, less sta-\\nble, less able to cope, less successful and less well-adjusted\\nthan people without epilepsy (Collins, 1990). Children and\\nadolescents with epilepsy who experience felt stigma have\\nbeen shown to have lower self-esteem and increased anxi-\\nety and depression.\\nPREVALENCE OF FELTSTIGMA\\nANDIMPACT ON LIFESUCCESS\\nFelt stigma has been reported by as few as 14% of\\npeople with seizures in remission, and as many as 51%\\nof self-help group members, with a clear relationship be-\\ntween felt stigma, seizure frequency, and illness trajectory\\n(Jacoby, 2002). Not all people with epilepsy experi-\\nence stigma but in those who do felt stigma has been\\npositively associated with learned helplessness, depres-\\nsion and anxiety, impaired physical health status, in-\\ncreased somatic symptoms and other health problems,\\nreduced self-esteem, and reduced life satisfaction. Per-\\nceived stigma has been shown to be an important pre-\\ndictor of quality of life (QOL), accounting for more of\\nthe variance in QOL scores than clinical variables. Adults\\nwith high felt stigma also may experience greater diffi-\\nculty with managing treatment regimes and medication\\nadherence.\\nPREVALENCE OF ENACTED STIGMA\\nThe prevalence of enacted stigma has not been system-\\natically documented. Much research has focused on the\\n“hard end” of enacted stigma, while failing to document\\nits more subtle aspects (Robson, 2006). In a recent study\\nin the U.K. of insurance difficulties encountered by people\\nwith epilepsy (one form of enacted stigma), 62% of respon-\\ndents reported difficulty obtaining insurance coverage and\\n36% had been refused insurance on grounds of epilepsy.\\nThe low employment rates found in many countries amongpeople with epilepsy are almost certainly partly a reflection\\nof enacted stigma. A recent study of UK employers’ atti-\\ntudes towards employing people with epilepsy noted that\\n21% reported that employing people with epilepsy would\\nbe “a major issue” and 44% that epilepsy was a health con-\\ndition that would cause them high concern. Epilepsy was\\ncommonly reported as likely to lead to work accidents,\\nlikely to lead to work absenteeism, likely to make other em-\\nployees uncomfortable, and likely to increase employers’\\ninsurance liability—for which reasons, 76% of employers\\nthought people with epilepsy should disclose their condi-\\ntion, even when they had been seizure-free for two years.\\nHOWCANWEHELPINDIVIDUALS IN\\nTHEFACE OF EPILEPSY STIGMA ?\\nFirst, we need to recognize and act upon the complex-\\nity and variability of the social meaning of epilepsy, both\\nacross and within cultures. Second, we need to understand\\nthat not all people with epilepsy embrace the notion of\\nstigma; however, for those who do there is a clear neg-\\native impact on their QOL. Third, for those affected by\\nstigma we need to help them develop resilience by provid-\\ning guidance about legitimate discriminations and practical\\nsolutions and support for illegitimate discriminations and\\nstigma. Fourth, we need to address negative coping strate-\\ngies and challenge negative assumptions in people with\\nepilepsy themselves (both adults and children), their fam-\\nilies and their wider social networks, through tested inter-\\nvention strategies at all the levels at which stigma operates.\\nHow can we support people with epilepsy as a collective\\ngroup? First and foremost, we need to be cognizant that\\ndisability, and its associated stigma, is a social, and so a\\nchangeable, construction. A key political role of epilepsy\\nsupport groups must be to challenge the current social\\nconstruction of epilepsy as disability and as stigma. We\\nalso need to challenge and aim to reduce existing treat-\\nment gaps. People with epilepsy deserve well-formulated\\nlegislative support such as is embodied in the US Amer-\\nicans with Disabilities Act, the U.K. Disability Discrimi-\\nnation Act and recent European Union driving regulations.\\nFinally, we need to champion a better resourced research\\nagenda into the social realities of epilepsy, and the ways\\nthese can be improved.\\nDisclosure of Conflicts of Interest\\nThe contributing authors to this article have declared the\\nfollowing conflicts of interest: Dr. Jacoby is currently act-\\ning as a paid consultant to UCB and EISAI; Dr. Austin has\\ndeclared no conflicts of interest.\\nREFERENCES\\nAustin JK, Shafer PO, Deering JB.

Introduction\\nChildren with chronic seizures experience more academ-\\nic problems than healthy children or children with otherchronic health conditions, such as asthma [1–6], and also\\nmake less academic progress than would be expected for\\ntheir age and intelligence quotient (IQ) level [7,8]. In longi-\\ntudinal studies, children with chronic epilepsy failed toshow improvement in academic performance over timeand, despite an improvement in their seizure conditions,continued to perform worse than a healthy control group[9]and an asthma comparison sample [10].\\nAlthough the majority of studies of children with chron-\\nic seizures have reported academic diﬃculties, studies areless consistent in delineating factors predicting underper-\\nformance. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated asso-ciations between academic performance and severaldemographic, neurological, and seizure-related variables,including age, gender, certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs),and seizure frequency. Younger age at onset of seizures\\nhas been associated with higher rates of academic under-\\nachievement [7,8,11–13] . Furthermore, earlier age at onset\\nof recurrent seizures was found to be the strongest predic-tor of cognitive impairment, including academic achieve-ment, in children with complex partial seizures [13].\\nOther studies, however, found no relationships betweenage at onset of seizures and neurocognitive scores [14,15] .\\nAlthough some early studies reported higher academic\\nachievement for females than for males with epilepsy\\n[16–18] , others found no main eﬀect for gender [7,19] .I n\\na recent study, Austin and colleagues [10]reported males\\nwith high-severity epilepsy to be at greatest risk for\\n1525-5050/$ - see front matter /C2112007 Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive problems from AEDs might\\nresult from sedation, attention diﬃculties, or mood distur-bances. Older AEDs, including phenobarbital and benzodi-azepines, and the newer AED topiramate have beenassociated with adverse cognitive eﬀects, but studies arelimited on the eﬀects of other newer AEDs on cognitive\\nfunction [20–22] . Williams et al. [19]found no diﬀerences\\nin performance on cognitive measures between childrenwith new-onset seizures before and after 6 months of treat-ment with AEDs compared with children with recentlydiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Increased seizure frequencyhas been negatively related to performance in some studies[7,23–26] , although other studies have found that seizure\\nvariables are not strongly related to academic achievement\\n[2,4,14,27] .\\nTo more clearly deﬁne the etiology and natural history\\nof academic diﬃculties, longitudinal studies beginningearly in the course of the seizure disorder are needed.To date, only four studies have examined academic prob-lems among children with new-onset seizures, and in twoof the studies [4,14] , data on children with both new-onset\\nand chronic seizures were combined and not reported sep-\\narately. Berg et al. [28]enrolled children 1 month to 16\\nyears of age into a study of new-onset epilepsy andreported academic progress at a 5-year follow-up. Theyfound that children with remote symptomatic epilepsyor an epileptic encephalopathy were more likely to receivespecial education services, an indirect measure of academ-ic performance. They did not obtain speciﬁc measures ofeach child’s academic performance. The ﬁnal study by\\nOostrom and colleagues [27,29] compared children\\nenrolled in regular school classrooms who had experi-enced two or more unprovoked idiopathic or cryptogenicseizures within the past year with gender-matched normalclassmate controls. They found that children with epilepsyscored signiﬁcantly worse on academic skills (reading,writing, and math) than controls, and, over the year fol-lowing entry into the study, there was a decline in these\\nskills. This decline, however, was in children whose par-\\nents had reported problems with skill acquisition priorto the onset of epilepsy. Follow-up 3–4 years after diag-nosis also revealed that learning problems prior to thediagnosis of epilepsy was the only variable predictingcontinuing academic diﬃculty. The sample was small(N= 51) and restricted to children with idiopathic or\\ncryptogenic epilepsy, reducing the generalizability of the\\nﬁndings. Although the ﬁndings of these four studies are\\ninformative, research did not compare children withnew-onset seizures to children with another chronic healthcondition, which makes it diﬃcult to know if problemswere associated with seizure onset or with onset of achronic health condition. Moreover, these studies didnot explore subgroups of children with new-onset seizuresto determine which ones were at greatest risk for academ-\\nic problems or for developing them over time.\\nIn this study, we have tried to determine the natural\\nhistory of cognitive problems associated with child-hood-onset epilepsy. We hypothesized three possible out-\\ncomes. First, if the academic diﬃculties of children withepilepsy are related to underlying central nervous systemdysfunction, the child should have cognitive impairmentat the onset of the seizures. Second, if the cognitiveproblems are the result of continuing seizures or an\\nadverse eﬀect of medication, academic diﬃculties should\\nnot be present at the onset of seizures but should emergein those children with recurrent seizures or in those treat-ed with AEDs. Third, if the academic problems of chil-dren with epilepsy are a nonspeciﬁc response to achronic illness, their academic problems should worsenover time with recurrent seizures, but should not diﬀerfrom problems found in children with the chronic condi-\\ntion of asthma.\\nThe purpose of this study was to address these three\\npossibilities by determining if children with new-onsetseizures diﬀered on academic performance both at onsetand over time compared with children with asthma. Oursample diﬀered from previous samples in several aspects.Children were recruited immediately following a ﬁrst-recognized seizure. Neurological status was monitored\\nand academic performance was assessed using teachers’\\nratings at baseline and at 12 and 24 months. Data fromschool-administered standardized achievement tests wereused to validate the teachers’ ratings of performance.Children with recurrent seizures were compared withchildren with no recurrences, and both groups were com-pared with a sample of children with a recent increase inseverity of asthma.\\nTo investigate which of the three possible outcomes was\\nmost likely, we formulated two speciﬁc research questions.\\n1. Are there diﬀerences in academic performance over time\\n(baseline, 12 months, and 24 months) by age, gender, orgroup (asthma, recurrent seizures, no recurrentseizures)?\\n2. In the seizure sample, are there diﬀerences in academic\\nperformance over time (baseline, 12 months, 24 months)\\nby age, gender, medication use, seizure type/epilepsysyndrome (primary generalized absence, primary gener-alized tonic–clonic or atonic–akinetic, primary partial,other), or seizure group (recurrent seizures, no recurrentseizures)?\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Research design\\nAs part of a larger study examining how neurological variables interact\\nwith other child and family variables to predict child mental health distur-\\nbances and academic problems [30], a sample of 121 children with new-on-\\nset seizures and a comparison sample of 54 children with recent onset ofmore severe asthma were studied. The descriptive statistics for age, race,\\nand education of primary caregiver (a measure of socioeconomic status)\\nfor children with asthma versus seizures are summarized in Table 1 . Dif-\\nferences in these demographic variables between children with asthmaand children with seizures were tested, and all were nonsigniﬁcant\\n(P> 0.1). As can be seen in Table 2 , mean academic performance Tscores312 A.M. McNelis et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 10 (2007) 311–318by group (asthma, recurrent seizures, no recurrent seizures) and time\\n(baseline, 12 months, 24 months) were in the average range and were with-\\nin half a standard deviation of norms.\\nBoth samples were followed prospectively for 24 months. Participants\\nwere recruited from emergency rooms, outpatient pediatric clinics, private\\nneurologists, and EEG laboratories. Prior to data collection, informed\\nconsent was obtained from parents and assent from children. The studywas approved by the respective institutional review boards.\\n2.1.1. Seizure sample\\nChildren in the new-onset seizure group were included in the study if\\nthey met the following criteria: (1) they were between 4 and 14 years ofage; (2) they had had a ﬁrst-recognized seizure-like episode within the past\\n6 weeks that did not occur within 1 week following a head injury and/or\\nwas not caused by a metabolic condition; (3) they did not have a history oftwo or more febrile seizures; (4) they had no other chronic medical condi-\\ntion requiring long-term care; (5) they had an IQ of P70 (per school\\nrecords, parent report of IQ, or placement of child in a regular classroom);and (6) they did not have a sibling with a chronic medical condition. Chil-dren who had had an unrecognized seizure prior to the baseline were also\\neligible for the study. At each time-point, children with new-onset seizures\\nwere separated into either the recurrent or no recurrent seizure group.Children who were determined to have had a prior unrecognized seizurewere placed into the recurrent seizure group at baseline. At 12 and 24\\nmonths, children were placed into the recurrent seizure group if theyhad had at least one additional seizure in the prior year. Thus, a particular\\nchild could be in a diﬀerent seizure group (recurrent or no recurrent sei-zure) at each time point (baseline, 12 months, 24 months) depending onwhether he or she had had a seizure between the two time points.\\nSeizure variables (i.e., seizure type and epilepsy syndrome) were classi-\\nﬁed using International League Against Epilepsy criteria. Seizure type wasestablished using parents’ and physicians’ descriptions of the seizure and\\nresults of the EEG. Syndrome was determined from the description of\\nthe seizure, the child’s developmental history, results of the neurologicalexamination, EEG results, and neuroimaging ﬁndings. These two vari-ables were then combined into a seizure type/epilepsy syndrome variable\\nwith four classiﬁcations: primary generalized absence ( N= 11), primary\\ngeneralized tonic–clonic or atonic–akinetic ( N= 39), primary partial\\n(N= 26), and secondary partial or other ( N= 45). These decisions were\\nmade by author D.W.D.\\nAlong with other demographic statistics in Table 1 , seizure types are\\nalso listed. Generalized tonic–clonic and complex partial seizures account-ed for more than half of the seizures. At baseline, 57.9% of the children\\nwere taking an AED. This percentage increased to 66.1% at 12 months\\nand decreased to 55.8% at 24 months. Carbamazepine, valproic acid,and phenytoin were the most commonly prescribed medications. The per-centage of children taking carbamazepine was 44.4% at baseline and\\n20.0% at 24 months; for those taking valproic acid, 37.0% at baseline\\nand 21.9% at 24 months; and for those taking phenytoin, 16.4% at baselineand 7.1% at 24 months.\\n2.1.2. Asthma sample\\nChildren with asthma were included in the study if they met the follow-\\ning criteria: (1) they were between 4 and 14 years of age; (b) their previous-\\nly mild and infrequent asthma symptoms had become more severe within\\nthe past 6 weeks, which may have been indicated by a ﬁrst hospitalizationor treatment in the emergency room, ﬁrst referral to a specialist for eval-uation or management of the asthma, or initial placement on one or more\\ndaily medications; (3) they had no other chronic medical condition requir-\\ning long-term care; (4) they had an IQ of P70 (per school records, parent\\nreport of IQ, or placement of child in a regular classroom); and (5) theyhad no siblings with a chronic medical condition. Children with worsening\\nasthma were recruited instead of children with mild and intermittent asth-\\nma symptoms because the latter group typically receives short-term treat-ment for their asthma symptoms from a primary care physician. In thisstudy, we sought to identify children whose asthma symptoms were wors-\\nening because it would indicate the onset of a more chronic condition.\\nAt baseline, 78% of the parents of the children with asthma reported\\nthat their child had had active asthma symptoms of wheezing or coughing\\nepisodes in the past month (21% had had 30 or more episodes in the past\\nmonth). The majority of children were being treated with the inhalantsalbuterol (73.4%), cromolyn sodium (44.7%), corticosteroid (20.4%), andnedocromil sodium (18.9%).\\n2.2. Instrumentation\\nBaseline data were collected within 6 weeks of a child having a ﬁrst-rec-\\nognized seizure or an indication that their asthma condition was worsen-\\ning. Data collected during the baseline interview provided informationabout the child prior to the onset of the health condition. Informationon health condition was gathered from parents’ report and medical\\nrecords, information on academic performance was collected from the\\nteachers, and standardized test results were obtained from school records.\\n2.2.1. Academic performance\\nPerformance was measured using Tscores from the teacher’s rating of\\nperformance (TRP). The TRP was obtained from the Teacher’s ReportForm of the Child Behavior Checklist (TRF), on which teachers rate class-\\nroom performance in six academic subject areas on a scale from 1 (far\\nbelow grade level) to 5 (far above grade), and ratings are summed to createa total score that reﬂects overall performance [31]. Baseline school perfor-\\nmance was obtained from the teacher who had the child in school during\\nthe 2 months prior to the onset of the health condition.

The TRP isnormed for age and gender, with a mean of 50 and SD of 10, and wasfound to have good validity and reliability in past research [31].\\nTo validate the TRP, we obtained standardized scores from group\\nachievement tests that were administered in the schools. The total batteryis a component of standardized tests providing information about speciﬁc\\nacademic skills and reﬂecting the curriculum used in the schools. Although\\ndiﬀerent types of school-administered standardized tests are used by thevarious school systems, the contents of these tests are similar across gradesand the scores tend to be highly correlated. Additionally, because these\\ntests are nationally normed and based on a normal distribution, direct\\ncomparison is possible [32]. The total battery is normed for age and gender\\nand similarly has a mean of 50 and SD of 10. The tests include measures ofbasic academic skills such as reading, language, and math, as well as a\\ntotal composite score (total battery) that is an overall measure of perfor-\\nmance. Because of the limited testing schedule in schools (children do notundergo testing at every grade level), not all children had test results at all\\nthree data collections. We used total battery scores that were closest in\\ntime to each data collection.\\n2.3. Statistical methods\\nFor the ﬁrst research question, which examined diﬀerences between the\\nseizure and asthma groups in academic performance over time as mea-sured by the TRP, a longitudinal linear mixed model was used. A com-\\npound symmetry variance–covariance structure was assumed. The\\noutcome variable was change from the baseline TRP Tscore. Subject\\nwas treated as a random eﬀect; group (asthma, recurrent seizures, norecurrent seizures) and gender were ﬁxed eﬀects; and age, time, and the\\nbaseline TRP score were continuous covariates. Time was included as\\nmonths since baseline visit.\\nAll children had a baseline and at least one TRP follow-up score; 110\\nchildren had all three TRP scores; 44 children had only a baseline and 12-\\nmonth score; and 21 had only a baseline and 24-month score. Within the\\ngroup variable, recurrent seizures was treated as a time-varying covariate.Because our sample was children with new-onset seizures, we thought itlikely that a child could fully recover from having one seizure, as opposed\\nto it having a permanent eﬀect on the child’s academic performance. Thus,\\nwe decided to make the group a time-varying covariate and look at theeﬀect of recent seizures on TRP as opposed to the eﬀect of having an addi-\\ntional seizure at any time in the past. The three-way interaction term\\namong gender, time, and group (asthma, recurrent seizures, and norecurrent seizures), as well as the two-way interaction terms gender ·time,\\ngender ·group, and time ·group were tested.\\nFor the second research question, which focused only on the seizure sam-\\nple, the analyses were similar to those for the ﬁrst research question butincluded variables for treatment with any AEDs in the prior time interval(yes or no) and seizure type/epilepsy syndrome. The associations among\\nage, gender, time (baseline, 12 months, 24 months), AED use (yes or no), sei-\\nzure type/epilepsy syndrome, and recurrent seizure group (yes or no), adjust-ing for baseline TRP score, with change from the baseline TRP Tscore were\\ninvestigated. The two-way interaction terms gender ·time, gender ·group,\\nand time ·group were also included in the model. The interaction term med-\\nication use ·group was not included in the model because there were so few\\nchildren who were having recurrent seizures but were not taking medication,\\nespecially at 24 months, when only four children ﬁt this category.\\nBecause our sample size of children who had baseline plus one total\\nbattery score was limited ( N= 77), descriptive statistics for the school-\\nadministered standardized achievement test total battery scores were\\ncalculated and qualitatively compared with the TRP Tscores.\\n3. Results\\nAre there diﬀerences in academic performance (TRP)\\nover time (baseline, 12 months, 24 months) by age, gender,or group (asthma, recurrent seizures, no recurrent seizures)?Neither the three-way interaction gender ·time·group,\\nnor the two-way interactions gender ·time and gen-\\nder·group were statistically signiﬁcant ( P> 0.2) so the\\nresults presented are based on the model without theseinteraction terms. Although the interaction between groupand time was not statistically signiﬁcant ( P= 0.098), it was\\nkept in the model because it was suggestive of a possible\\ninteraction eﬀect. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , the scores of\\nchildren with asthma remained fairly constant over the24-month period. The scores of both children with andthose without recurrent seizures decreased from baselineto 12 months. However, between 12 and 24 months, thescores of children with recurrent seizures continued todecline, whereas the scores for children not experiencing\\nrecurrent seizures increased back to their baseline level.\\nNeither gender ( F(1,160) = 0.00, P= 0.972), time (baseline,\\n12 months, 24 months: F(1,163) = 0.65, P= 0.422), group\\n(asthma, recurrent seizures, no recurrent seizures:F(2,211) = 1.84, P= 0.162), nor age ( F(1,159) = 3.66,\\nP= 0.058) was signiﬁcantly associated with the change in\\nTRP from baseline. Although age was not signiﬁcantlyassociated with the change in TRP from baseline, the trend\\nwas for younger children to decline more than older chil-\\ndren. This was true for children in all groups. The averagedecline from baseline to 24 months was 1.6 points amongchildren younger than 10. In children older than 10, theaverage decline from baseline to 24 months was 0.3 point.\\nIn the seizure sample, are there diﬀerences in academic\\nperformance, as measured by the TRP, over time (baseline,12 months, 24 months) by age, gender, AED use, seizure\\ntype/epilepsy syndrome (primary generalized absence, pri-\\nmary generalized tonic–clonic or atonic–akinetic, primarypartial, secondary partial or other), or seizure group (recur-rent seizures, no recurrent seizures)?\\nThere were neither signiﬁcant gender ·time nor gen-\\nder·recurrent seizure interaction eﬀects ( P> 0.6), so the\\nPvalues are based on the model without these two interac-\\ntion terms. There was a signiﬁcant time ·recurrent seizure\\ninteraction eﬀect ( P= 0.042).

McNelis et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 10 (2007) 311–318and without recurrent seizures declined from baseline a\\nsimilar amount (0.88 and 1.07, respectively), but by 24months this decreasing trend had reversed for childrenwithout recurrent seizures. At 24 months, the scores of chil-dren without recurrent seizures were actually 0.49 pointhigher than their baseline scores. In contrast, the scores\\nof children with recurrent seizures continued to decline\\nanother 1.59 points for a total decline of 2.47 points frombaseline, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . To explain the apparent\\ndiscrepancy between this analysis and the analysis for theﬁrst research question (where only a marginally signiﬁcantgroup ·time interaction was noted), refer to Fig. 1 and\\nnote that the asthma sample means were relatively stableacross time and ﬂuctuated near the overall mean across\\nall groups and times. This resulted in a lower estimate of\\nthe variability due to the group ·time interaction for the\\nmodel in the ﬁrst research question than in the secondresearch question, whereas the estimates of the residualvariance in the two models were similar. Thus, the F\\nstatistic for the interaction of group and time reached onlymarginal signiﬁcance in the ﬁrst research question.\\nThere were no signiﬁcant age, gender, or seizure type/\\nepilepsy syndrome eﬀects ( F(1,106) = 3.36, P= 0.070;\\nF(1,109) = 0.13, P= 0.719; F(3,104) = 1.56, P= 0.205,\\nrespectively); however, there was the same age trend aswhen asthma children were included in the model: Youngerchildren tended to decline more than older children. Theaverage decline from baseline to 24 months was 2.1 pointsamong children younger than 10 and 0.1 point for childrenolder than 10. There was a signiﬁcant eﬀect of medication\\nuse on academic performance ( F(1,177) = 4.12,\\nP= 0.044). Among children without recurrent seizures\\nwho were taking AEDs, scores increased slightly by 0.42point at 12 months but then increased 2.30 points at 24months. Among children without recurrent seizures whowere not taking AEDs, scores decreased 2.09 points frombaseline to 12 months, but at 24 months, scores were0.82 point above their 12-month score, as illustrated in\\nFig. 2 . In contrast, among children with recurrent seizures\\nwho were on AEDs, scores decreased 0.82 point from base-line to 12 months, and decreased an additional 3.26 pointsat 24 months.\\nIn a subgroup of children who had total battery scores,\\npost hoc analyses were conducted to validate the TRPscores. Out of the 175 children with a baseline TRP scoreand at least one follow-up, 26 children had three total bat-\\ntery scores, 51 children had a baseline battery score and\\none follow-up score, 23 children had only a baseline totalbattery score, and 43 children did not have a baseline bat-tery score but had at least one follow-up. In general, theschool-administered total battery achievement scores fol-lowed a pattern similar to that of the TRP scores. Themeans for each achievement area are listed in Tables 3\\nand 4 . For children having recurrent seizures, both the\\nTRP and battery scores decreased from baseline to 12\\nmonths and continued to decrease between 12 and 24months. The total TRP score decline was 2.47 points andthe total battery score decline was 9.59 points. The TRP\\nscores in children without recurrent seizures and the bat-tery scores in both children without recurrent seizuresand children with asthma declined between baseline and12 months and then increased between 12 and 24 months.The TRP scores for children with asthma increasedbetween baseline and 12 months and then declined slightly\\nbetween 12 and 24 months.\\n4. Discussion\\nThe purpose of this study was to compare teacher’s rat-\\nings of academic performance over a 24-month period\\n(baseline, 12 months, and 24 months) between childrenwith new-onset seizures and those with asthma. Three pos-sible outcomes were tested. The ﬁrst—if the academic diﬃ-culties of children with epilepsy were caused by underlyingcentral nervous system dysfunction, the child should havecognitive impairment at the onset of the seizures—wasnot supported. Children with seizures were not having\\nproblems at condition onset as indicated by performance\\nscores within the normal range. The ﬁnding that childrenwith asthma were performing well academically is consis-tent with the literature indicating average to above-averageachievement [2,10,33–35] and few illness-related academic\\nVisit4547495153Mean TRP\\nNo AEDs\\nAEDs\\nBaseline 12 Months 24 Months\\nFig. 2.

McNelis et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 10 (2007) 311–318 315problems in this population [33,36] . However, the ﬁnding\\nthat the children with seizures were doing well academicallycontrasts with prior research that found achievement prob-lems in children with chronic seizures [1–6]. Our results\\nsuggest that the achievement problems observed in children\\nwith epilepsy may develop over time and might be relatedto the epileptic condition. At the beginning, these problemsmay be more subtle, but over time they appear to becomemore pronounced. Our discovery of a decline at 24 monthsassociated with recurrent seizures provides partial supportfor this interpretation.\\nThe second possibility—achievement problems were\\nthe result of continuing seizures or an adverse eﬀect of\\nmedication, and therefore academic diﬃculties wouldnot be present at the onset of seizures but would emergein those children with recurrent seizures or in those onantiepileptic drugs—was supported. We found that scoresfor children in both groups (with and without recurrentseizures) were in the normal range at onset and initiallydeclined at 12 months, but children who did not have\\nrecurrent seizures improved and exceeded their baseline\\nscores at 24 months. The children who continued to haverecurrent seizures showed further decline at 24 months.There was a trend for the performance scores of childrenwho were seizure-free on AEDs to improve over the 24months. These ﬁndings are consistent with past literaturesupporting the relationship between active seizures andpoorer academic performance. Austin and colleagues\\n[37]found that children with active epilepsy had lower\\nscores on school progress and intellectual self-conceptthan children with inactive epilepsy. Intractable epilepsyin children with onset before age 2 has been associatedwith poor cognitive functioning [38]. Moreover, in the\\nsample of children with new-onset seizures, our ﬁndingthat academic performance among those with recurrentseizures tended to decline over time is consistent with\\nresults from previous research [7,8,10,32] , emphasizing\\nthe importance of identifying academic diﬃculties amongchildren with seizures as early as possible so that inter-ventions may be implemented that limit the progressionof problems. This ﬁnding is even more important in lightof the fact that our sample included only children withnormal development and they were starting to show\\ndecline over time.\\nThe last possibility—academic problems of children\\nwith epilepsy are a nonspeciﬁc response to a chronic illness,\\nand therefore academic problems should worsen over time\\nwith both recurrent seizures and asthma—was harder toassess. The TRP scores were in the average range overthe 24 months for all three groups. There was no declineover the 24-month period in children with asthma nor inthe children without recurrent seizures; however, therewas decline in those children with recurrent seizures. Thissuggests that academic performance may be aﬀected more\\nby seizures than by the nonspeciﬁc eﬀect of a chronic ill-\\nness, but a longer period of observation in a larger sampleis required to settle this question.\\nAdditional ﬁndings from the study were that the aca-\\ndemic performance of younger children in the samplesdeclined more than that of the older children over the 2years of the study. These results are consistent with previ-ous ﬁndings in which younger age at onset of seizures\\nhas been associated with higher rates of academic under-\\nachievement [7,8,11–13] . Older children may have more\\ncompensatory strategies than younger children and, thus,are able to sustain achievement despite their chroniccondition [39].\\nTRP scores were congruent with the scores obtained\\nfrom the standardized achievement tests (total battery).Moreover, the pattern of change over time was also consis-\\ntent between the two measures. This is important because it\\nshows that the cognitive performance of the child in a com-prehensive epilepsy clinic can be monitored using the teach-er’s reports. Whereas standardized tests are usually givenevery 2 to 3 years, teachers rate students daily, and quarter-ly or semester summaries can be used to closely monitor achild’s progress so that decline can be identiﬁed early,instead of waiting for the infrequent results supplied by\\nthe standardized tests.\\n4.1.

Second, our sample size did not allow us to con-trol for speciﬁc AEDs or AED blood levels. A third limita-\\ntion of the study is that gross measures of academic\\nperformance were used, which did not assess the more spe-ciﬁc components of learning that individual neurocognitivetests would provide. Although limiting, these gross mea-sures are what is available most often for school-aged chil-dren and can be useful as a way for teachers and healthcare professionals to monitor children’s progress at fre-quent intervals. The use and timing of standardized tests\\nare also limitations of the study. A ﬁnal limitation involves\\nthe uneven groups because of missing scores, with some ofthe seizure samples having small cell sizes, so interpretationmust be tentative.\\n4.2. Clinical implications\\nFor professionals working with children with seizures,\\nseveral points should be apparent. Not all children will\\nhave problems keeping up in school; however, given thehigh rates of academic performance problems seen inchronic samples, the initial decline seen in this new-onsetsample, and the continued decline seen in children withrecurrent seizures, careful monitoring of academic perfor-mance is warranted. Additional psychoeducational assess-ment should be obtained when academic decline is noted.\\nIn relation to determining who may be at greatest risk\\nfor academic problems among children with new-onset sei-zures, ﬁndings from the current study and other researchclearly suggest that recurrent seizures and younger age ofonset are factors that need to be considered. Althoughour study was an improvement over past designs, we donot know if academic performance will continue to decline,plateau, or improve beyond 2 years. Further research is\\nneeded to explore the pattern of change after condition\\nonset and to describe academic outcomes associated withliving with seizures.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThis research was supported by Grant PHS R01\\nNS22416 from the National Institute of Neurological Dis-\\norders and Stroke to Joan K.

Both aﬀective disorders and\\npsychoses have been reported to occur at increased fre-quency in people with epilepsy [1,2]. This association is well\\nrecognized in those with a learning disability (LD) (some-times referred to as intellectual disability), who also tendto have more severe epilepsy [3–8].\\nSeveral mechanisms potentially underlying the associa-\\ntion between epilepsy and psychopathology have been\\ndescribed, including the direct consequences of epileptic\\nbrain activity [9]and lower IQ [10]leading to interictaland postictal psychiatric states, antiepileptic drug (AED)\\neﬀects [11,12] , and a biological but poorly understood reci-\\nprocal relationship between epileptic severity and behav-\\nioral symptoms that has been described in relation to\\nrelative or absolute reductions in seizure frequency (‘‘alter-native psychoses’’) or epileptogenic EEG activity (‘‘forcednormalisation’’) (see Krishnamoorthy et al. [13]and Wolf\\n[14]for reviews of this topic). However, despite observa-\\ntions suggesting a link between lower IQ and psychopa-thology in epilepsy and the observed frequency andseverity of epilepsy and psychopathology in those with\\nLD[15], many studies of the relationship between seizures\\nand psychopathology either have excluded people with LDor have not examined the potential diﬀerential eﬀects ofvarying severity of LD on the manifestation of psychopa-thology. We have therefore investigated the nature of psy-chopathology in a group of patients with LD and epilepsy,ascertained from community LD health services.\\n1525-5050/$ - see front matter /C2112007 Elsevier Inc.

Method\\nThis observational study collected data describing the epilepsy, learn-\\ning disability, and any psychopathology manifest by patients under thecare of community LD teams in one county of England. Consent to pro-vide these data was obtained from those patients with the capacity to\\nmake this decision; for those unable to give consent, assent was sought\\nfrom their prime carer. The study was approved by the local research eth-ics committee.\\nParticipants were ascertained from those being actively managed by\\ntheir local community LD team. A trained researcher identiﬁed thosepatients who had epilepsy in addition to LD by reviewing their clinical notesand checking with LD team clinicians. For each identiﬁed and consenting/\\nassenting participant, a trained researcher collected information regarding\\ntheir epilepsy, their learning disability, and any psychiatric diagnosis pres-ent over the 3 months preceding the date of data collection. This informa-tion was gathered using a structured data collection form retrospectively\\nfrom clinical notes and contemporaneously from interviews with the LD\\nservice, general practitioner, any involved specialist hospital services, anda carer who was familiar with the participant’s recent state. The information\\nobtained was entered onto an Excel database and subsequently analyzed\\nusing SPSS. The severity of LD described was that which had previouslybeen determined by each participant’s community LD team, most oftenby use of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale. In the United Kingdom,\\nto have been eligible for clinical LD services in the ﬁrst place, individuals\\nneed to have a measured Full Scale IQ 670. The IQ bands associated with\\nthe descriptions of LD severity used in this study were those routinelyemployed in UK clinical practice: mild = 50–70, moderate = 35–50,\\nsevere = 20–35, and profound <20. The learning disabilities in these\\npatients were all part of a pervasive developmental disability, and individ-uals with acquired or limited speciﬁc intellectual deﬁcits were not includedin the study sample. The epilepsy diagnoses used in the study were those\\nreported in the participants’ clinical notes, where necessary clariﬁed by fur-\\nther perusal of available clinical, EEG, and imaging data by the authors.The great majority of participants in the study lived with and were closely\\nsupported by family or paid carers. Seizure frequency was determined by\\ninterviewing the participants’ carers, the majority of whom had previouslyattended epilepsy training days on which they had been taught how to rec-ognize and record seizure frequencies and types. Although some patients\\nmay have also experienced unobserved seizures, because all the patients\\nin the study were under the care of specialist LD teams whose members rou-tinely inquired about the patients’ epilepsy, we think it likely that the seizurerecording was relatively accurate. The psychopathology descriptions\\nemployed—depression, psychosis, challenging behaviour, and self-injuri-\\nous behaviour—were based on clinical descriptions obtained from the clin-ical notes or from health care professionals who knew the patients. The term\\ndepression was used to describe subjectively reported or objectively noted\\nsigns or symptoms of low mood, whereas the term psychosis was used to\\ndescribe psychotic phenomena such as hallucinations and delusions, butdid not include peri-ictal confusional states. The psychiatric accounts were\\nclinical descriptions and did not necessarily meet relevant ICD/DSM crite-\\nria for formal psychiatric diagnoses. To obtain an overall measure of cur-rent seizure severity, the study population was divided into those whohad no reported seizures over the 3 months prior to the time of data collec-\\ntion and those who had experienced at least one seizure over this period.\\n3. Results\\nAltogether, data were obtained describing 175 individu-\\nals with a LD who also had a diagnosis of epilepsy. The agerange of the study population was 16–72, with a mean of 40(SD = 11), and 56% of the sample were male. A wide rangeof diﬀerent etiologies for the LD were noted, the most fre-quent of which were cerebral palsy in 18% and Down’s syn-\\ndrome in 5%. In 36% no clear cause of LD could be\\nidentiﬁed. Overall, the mean duration of epilepsy in thesample was 26 years (SD = 17, range = 1–71). The mean\\nmonthly seizure frequency over the 3 months precedingthe study was 7.2, with a range of 0 to 90 seizures permonth. Of the 175 patients considered in this study, 65had not experienced any seizures in the 3 months prior tothe study, whereas 110 had experienced at least one seizure.\\nThe mean monthly seizure frequency of those with at least\\none seizure in these 3 months was 11.4. The type of epilepsysyndrome present could be established in 56% of the studypopulation, with almost all having either an idiopathic gen-eralized epilepsy (70 individuals) or a focal epilepsy (24individuals) syndrome. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀer-ences between those who had had and those who had nothad seizures in the preceding 3 months with respect to\\nthe proportions with an idiopathic generalized compared\\nwith a focal epilepsy syndrome. Relevant descriptors ofthose with and without any seizures in the 3 months pre-ceding the study are contrasted in Table 1 .\\nAs shown in Table 1 , while those with and without\\nrecent seizures were similar in terms of age, gender distribu-tion, and duration of their epilepsy, those with recent sei-zures, on average, were prescribed more AEDs and had\\nless mild and more severe LD.\\nTo investigate the relationship between seizure fre-\\nquency and psychopathology, we identiﬁed which partici-pants had experienced a psychotic disorder, anonpsychotic depressive disorder, challenging behaviour,or self-harm over the same 3-month period preceding thestudy that the seizure frequency data described. The psy-chopathology reported in this group of patients is\\ndescribed in Table 2 .\\nExamining the prevalence of psychopathological states\\nin those with and without any seizures in the 3 months pre-ceding the study demonstrated that the proportion of thosewith no seizures who had experienced psychopathology\\nTable 1\\nComparisons between those with and without recent seizures\\nNo seizures\\nin past\\n3 months\\n(N= 65)At least one\\nseizure in past\\n3 months\\n(N= 110)\\nAge 41.2 39.6\\nGender (male) 57% 54%\\nEpilepsy duration (years) 24.6 26.3\\nEpilepsy syndrome, where known\\nIdiopathic generalized ( N= 70) 72% 74%\\nFocal ( N= 24) 28% 26%\\nNumber of AEDs prescribeda1.4 2.1\\nSeverity of LDb\\nMild 31% 14%\\nModerate 20% 15%Severe 46% 65%\\nProfound 3% 6%\\nat(171) = /C05.438, P< 0.001.\\nbPearson’s v2(4) = 10.846, P= 0.028.H.

Examination of Table 3\\nreveals that both psychosis and depressive disorderoccurred at increased frequency in those with no seizuresin the preceding 3 months, whereas challenging behaviorand self-injurious behavior occurred at similar ratesregardless of recent seizure frequency.\\nAs noted in Table 1 , those with no recent seizures had\\nhigher rates of mild LD and lower rates of severe LD than\\nthose who were experiencing continuing seizures. Toaddress the question of whether there was a relationshipbetween severity of LD and rates of psychopathology inthose with and without recent seizures, the frequencies ofpsychosis and depression were examined with respect tothe presence or absence of recent seizures in those withmild or severe LD ( Table 4 ). (Those with moderate or pro-found LD were not included in these analyses, as these lev-\\nels of LD occurred at similar rates in those with andwithout recent seizures).\\nExamination by hierarchical log-linear analysis of the\\ndata summarized in Table 4 demonstrates a borderline sig-\\nniﬁcant ( P= 0.054) three-way interaction between severity\\nof LD (mild or severe LD), seizure status (presence or\\nabsence of any seizures in the 3 months prior to the study),and diagnosis of depression or psychosis. Subsequently,2·2 table analyses of these data separately for those with\\nand those without continuing seizures were performed.These demonstrated that for those with no recent seizures,psychosis rates were higher in those with mild LD than inthose with severe LD, whereas those with severe LD had\\nhigher rates of depression than those with mild LD (Fish-\\ner’s exact test, P= 0.03). However, for those with at least\\none seizure in the 3 months preceding the study, therewas no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in psychosis or depressionrates between those with mild and those with severe LD.\\nTo establish whether the presence of depression or psy-\\nchosis was particularly associated with any AED, the fre-quencies with which each AED was prescribed were\\ncompared between those with and without these psychopa-\\nthologies. Altogether across the study cohort, 13 diﬀerentAEDs were prescribed, most commonly sodium valproate,carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. No AED was found to beprescribed more often in association with either depressionor psychosis or in those with no seizures in the preceding 3months compared with those with at least one seizure overthis time.\\nTo explore whether, in those with continuing seizures,\\nthere was an association between seizure frequency andpsychopathology rates, we compared rates of depressionand psychosis in those with one to four seizures per monthand those with more than four seizures per month (where 4was the median number of seizures per month in those withcontinuing seizures). We found no diﬀerence in the propor-tions of those with psychosis (respectively 11% vs 8% in\\nthose with more or less than the median number). There\\nwas a weak trend toward signiﬁcance ( v\\n2test, P= 0.095)\\nfor more frequent depression (in 28%) in those with moreas opposed to those with less than the median number (inwhom there was depression in 14%).\\n4.

These relationships between seizure frequencyand LD severity were not observed for more general mark-ers of psychological distress—challenging and self-injuri-ous behaviors. As far as the authors are aware, thisdetailed relationship between severity of LD and psychopa-\\nthology in relation to seizure frequency has not previously\\nbeen reported.\\n4.2. Relationship of these ﬁndings to other relevant research4.2.1. Psychopathology in people with epilepsy and LD\\nRates of depression and psychoses observed overall in\\nthis study resembled those reported in a Scottish popula-tion with epilepsy and LD by Espie et al. [6], who described\\npossible aﬀective or neurotic disorder in 29% of their sam-\\nple (compared with possible depression in 26% of thecurrent sample) and possible psychotic disorder in 10% oftheir sample (compared with possible psychosis in 11% ofthe current sample). In both that research and the currentstudy, the rates of psychosis observed were lower thanthe 24% reported in a Japanese population by Matsuuraet al. [7], but higher than the 4.4% reported in an English\\npopulation by Deb et al. [16]This wide range of prevalence\\nof psychosis may in part relate to diﬀerences in the diagnos-tic processes and deﬁnitions employed in these studies(although both Espie et al. [6]and Deb et al. [16]used\\nthe Psychiatric Assessment Schedule for Adults with Devel-opmental Disabilities [17](PAS-ADD) and ICD-10 crite-\\nria). However, the results of the current study suggestthat diﬀerences in overall rates of psychosis between studies\\nmay also relate both to diﬀerences in the relative propor-\\ntions of those with occasional, frequent, or currently no sei-zures and to the relative proportions of those with mild asopposed to more severe LD in the study populations.Although in the current study the most signiﬁcant ﬁndingwas of more psychopathology in those with no recent sei-zures, Espie et al. [6]found that increasing seizure fre-\\nquency predicted psychiatric cases. Although when\\nconsidering only those with at least one seizure we did note\\na small trend toward more depression in those with greaterseizure frequency, overall our results give an impression ofthe relationship between epilepsy and psychopathology dif-ferent from that described by Espie et al. This diﬀerencemay in part be related to the observation that in the currentstudy, 37% of participants had experienced no recent sei-zures, whereas in the study population described by Espie\\net al. [6], just 12% experienced seizures at a rate of less than\\none per month, leading to a smaller proportion of casesfrom which such observations could be made. The rate ofseizure freedom in the current study may be higher becauseour participants were recruited only from community LDservices, whereas Espie and colleagues also recruited partic-ipants from specialist epilepsy services, in which those withmore severe epilepsy are likely to be concentrated. With\\nrespect to the relationship between psychopathology and\\nseverity of LD in people with epilepsy, as noted above, thishas not been much explored, although Adachi et al. [9]\\nreported that rates of psychosis were observed across alltheir participants to be higher in those with mild than inthose with severe LD. However, those authors deﬁnedsevere LD simply as an IQ <70, which in UK services isthe cutoﬀ for entry to the description of LD, with those\\nhaving an IQ >70 not being considered to have LD [18].\\nIn the current study, we demonstrated distinct relation-ships between seizure frequency and psychopathology inthose whose IQ fell into mild (IQ = 50–70) and severe(IQ = 20–35) categories of LD.\\n4.2.2. The relationship between psychopathology and severity\\nof LD in those without epilepsy\\nThe pattern observed in those with no recent seizures, of\\nmore depression associated with severe LD and more psy-\\nchosis with mild LD, diﬀers from results reported inpatients with LD but no epilepsy, for whom varying resultshave been obtained. Holden and Gitlesen [19]reported\\nincreased rates of both depression and psychosis in thosewith moderate compared with those with severe or pro-found LD and concluded that prevalence of psychiatric ill-ness decreases with increasing severity of LD. More\\nrecently, however, in a community-based epidemiological\\nstudy, Cooper et al. looked for but did not ﬁnd a relation-ship between prevalence of depression and severity of LD[20]. However, it has also been pointed out that reports\\nof low prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, at leastin children with epilepsy and the most severe intellectualimpairment, may arise as a consequence of the diﬃcultyin identifying psychiatric symptoms in those with more\\nsevere LD [21]. Overall, however, in the current study psy-\\nchotic symptoms were observed in 20% of our participants,compared with the rate of clinically diagnosed psychoticdisorders of 4.4% in a community sample of people withLD, 39% of whom had mild LD and 19% severe LD [22],\\nsuggesting that compared with the study of patients withsevere LD but no epilepsy, we have not signiﬁcantly under-diagnosed psychotic symptoms in this group. Factors that\\nmay help explain the distribution of psychopathology\\nobserved in the current study could therefore include issuesrelated to diagnosis of psychopathology in those withdiﬀering severities of LD or to some aspect of the partici-pants’ chronic epileptic disorder.\\n4.3. Possible explanations of the ﬁndings\\nThe observations reported in Table 1 indicate that\\nwithin the study population, ongoing seizures were, notsurprisingly, associated with more severe epilepsy, reﬂectedin prescription of more AEDs. In addition, also as wouldbe predicted from previous observations, there were pro-portionately more people with a severe or profound LDin the group with continuing seizures. However, we alsonoted that there were higher rates of psychopathology in\\nthose with no recent seizures. This group comprised pro-\\nportionately fewer people with a severe or profound LD.\\nH. Ring et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 11 (2007) 92–97 95It is therefore important to consider whether the higher\\nrates of psychopathology in the seizure-free group couldhave arisen as a consequence of issues related to the detec-tion of psychiatric symptoms in those with the lowest IQs.\\nAs noted above, it is widely accepted that it is more dif-\\nﬁcult to make psychiatric diagnoses in people with severe\\nLD, who generally lack the language abilities to verbally\\ndescribe their psychological experiences, than it is in peoplewith mild or moderate LD [23]. In addition, for those at the\\nmost severe end of the LD spectrum, it remains unclearwhether behavioral disturbances that appear to indicatepsychological distress reﬂect psychological states that arecongruent with the depressive and psychotic statesdescribed in those with higher IQs. The diagnosis of psy-\\nchotic states may be particularly problematic in this con-\\ntext. This diﬃculty could have contributed in this studyto higher rates of depression, and particularly of psychosisin the group with no recent seizures, which contained pro-portionately fewer people with a severe or profound LD.However, examination of Table 4 reveals that the higher\\nrate of psychosis in the group with ‘‘no recent seizures’’was accounted for by higher psychosis rates not among\\nthose with severe LD (3% in those without vs 7% in those\\nwith recent seizures) but rather in those with mild LD (35%in those with vs 13% in those without recent seizures), inwhom the diagnosis is reasonably straightforward and reli-able. Considering depression, in this case the higher rate inthose with no recent seizures is accounted for by theincreased diagnosis of depression among those with severeLD in the patients with no recent seizures (41%) compared\\nto those with ongoing seizures and severe LD (15%). Hence\\nit seems unlikely that the increased rates of psychopathol-ogy in those with no recent seizures, compared with thosewith ongoing seizures, can be explained purely as a conse-quence of the higher proportion of those with more severeLD in the ongoing seizure group.\\nIt is, however the case that if only the ‘‘no recent sei-\\nzures’’ group is considered, the higher rates of psychosis\\nin those with mild compared with those with severe LD\\nmay have been more strongly related to the diﬃculties inidentifying psychotic symptoms in those with more severeLD. Although in the current study we cannot formallyquantify the potential size of this eﬀect, looking again atTable 4 , at the rates of psychosis among those with contin-\\nuing seizures, note that the ratio of psychotic symptoms inthose with mild versus those with severe LD is approxi-\\nmately 2:1. In those with no recent seizures, however, the\\nequivalent ratio is approaching 12:1. It is therefore possiblethat some other factor, in addition to the relative propor-tions of those with mild and severe LD in the two groups,is contributing to the increased rates of psychopathology inthose with no recent seizures.\\nOther articles exploring the association between\\nincreased psychopathology and relative or absolute reduc-\\ntions in seizure frequency or epileptogenic EEG activity\\nhave considered the possibility of a direct physiological link(described as alternative psychoses (AP) or forced normal-ization (FN) [13,14] ) between decreased epileptic activity\\nand the development of psychopathology. The majorityof prior reports of AP/FN have been in the form of smallcase series and anecdotal reports, most often describingpsychosis, with depression less frequently recognized as apossible manifestation of this phenomenon. [14,24] . How-\\never, as discussed below, the design of the current study\\ndoes not provide any account of the temporal relationshipbetween reduction in seizure frequency and development ofpsychopathology that would address the possibility of AP/FN being a mechanism in this study.\\nFinally, we did not identify associations between other\\nepilepsy-related variables and speciﬁc psychiatric symp-toms. In common with Espie at al. [6]and Deb [25],i n\\nthe current study it was noted that seizure type did not pre-\\ndict psychiatric state. With respect to AED use, althoughthere is an extensive literature relating the use of AEDsto the generation of psychopathology [11,12,26] , in the cur-\\nrent study the increased rates of depression and psychosiswere not related to the prescription of any speciﬁc AEDs.Conversely, some AEDs have eﬃcacy as mood stabilizers[18]. However, in the current study, the AEDs most often\\nprescribed; sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotri-\\ngine, which are also those AEDs most widely prescribed asmood stabilizers, were used with similar frequencies inthose with and without psychoses or depression and inthose with continuing seizures and those who wereseizure-free.\\n4.4. Study limitations\\nMost importantly, seizure frequency was obtained only\\nfor the 3-month period preceding the date of data collec-tion. We do not have data on any EEG changes thatmay or may not have been associated with seizure absence,nor are there data describing when the last recorded seizureoccurred in those who had been seizure-free for at least 3months, or when the psychiatric symptoms reported wereﬁrst observed. These factors mean that we cannot formally\\ndescribe the periods of seizure freedom with psychopathol-\\nogy as either forced normalization or alternative psychosesaccording to the criteria formulated by Krishnamoorthyand Trimble [27]. Another limitation of this study is that\\nthe data were obtained largely retrospectively, albeitmostly from contemporaneously prepared clinical records.The group studied were suﬀering from a wide range ofbrain disorders, and it is therefore not possible to relate\\ncognitive or psychiatric states observed to speciﬁc neuro-\\npathological processes. In addition, the epilepsy and psy-chopathology descriptions were derived from a relativelylarge number of diﬀerent clinicians, and as the criteria usedin the current study to deﬁne the presence of a particularpsychopathological state were based on clinical descrip-tions and diagnoses by these clinicians, it is likely that dif-ferent diagnostic processes were employed across the study\\ncohort. It is also important to emphasize that psychiatric\\ndescriptions employed in this study, although based on\\n96 H. Ring et al. / Epilepsy & Behavior 11 (2007) 92–97speciﬁc signs and symptoms, are clinical accounts and not\\nformal ICD or DSM diagnoses. Nevertheless, there is noevidence that these diagnostic processes diﬀered systemati-cally according to whether or not participants had experi-enced a recent seizure, and as noted above, rates ofdepression and psychosis observed in this study resembled\\nthose previously reported by Espie et al. [6].\\n5. Conclusions\\nWe suggest that the results of this study indicate that\\nin a proportion of those with LD and chronic epilepsy,seizure freedom is associated with the manifestation ofpotentially serious psychiatric symptoms. Our ﬁnding\\nthat the form in which this psychopathology manifests\\nis related to the level of overall functional brain distur-bance as reﬂected by LD severity resembles observationsby Wolf [14]made in the context of forced normaliza-\\ntion. He suggested that, although active inhibitory pro-cesses lead to both reduction of seizure activity anddevelopment of enhanced vulnerability to the develop-ment of psychopathology, a range of individual factors\\ndetermine the actual occurrence and form of the psycho-\\npathology. Applying this model, it is the diﬀerent biolog-ical and environmental associations of mild as opposedto severe LD that lead toward either depression or psy-chosis. Although the current study can only speculativelypropose this model as a possible explanation of the clin-ical observations reported, we believe that these observa-tions suggest that future research could usefully\\nprospectively investigate the eﬀects of alterations in sei-\\nzure frequency on the development of speciﬁc psycho-pathological states in patients with diﬀerent magnitudesof LD severity.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe are grateful to the patients and the Community\\nTeams and Carers of the patients whose data contributed\\nto this study.
